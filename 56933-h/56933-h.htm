<small>BARNABY LEARNS HIS NAME</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was towards the end of a very hot summer,
and all the human population of that crowded
square of the great city had spent the first half
of the night in the streets. Either that, or in
leaning halfway out of their windows to get a
breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>Now that sunrise was again so near at hand,
however, and the breeze from the sea had done so
much to make the world more comfortable to live
in, the closely-built &#8220;hotels&#8221; and tenement houses
were all asleep.</p>

<p>The former were mostly of the sort that sell
lager beer and other things in the basement, and
the latter were just the kind of places in which
men and women ought not to live.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Up in the third-story front room of one of those
hotels, however, a boy of about seventeen&mdash;a well-built,
dark-eyed, curly-headed, handsome boy&mdash;sat
on a wooden-seated chair, wide-awake, and
seemed to be studying the condition of somebody
who lay on the bed near him.</p>

<p>There was a curiously-set expression of determination
on the bright, young face, very much as
if he had made up his mind to do something, and
did not mean to be very long in going about it.</p>

<p>Such a ludicrously disreputable looking mess of
a man was the large figure that now began to
kick about so clumsily among the bedclothes!</p>

<p>He had not taken off his clothes on lying down,
and every one might have wondered what need
he had of extra blankets in such weather.</p>

<p>But now a grizzled head and a bloated face rose
slowly from the pillow&mdash;one of those faces which
defy any guess of within twenty years of their
actual age.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack&mdash;Jack Chills!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t my name, but here I am,&#8221; responded
the boy in the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more it is. Alas, for all my sins!&#8221; exclaimed
the man, &#8220;but you cannot deceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
your old uncle, my boy. I know what you&#8217;re
up to. You mean to take advantage of my
temporary indisposition and abandon me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the boy, curtly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be two
or three days before you get sober enough to follow
me, and I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I deserve it, I do,&#8221; was the mournful whine
of the man on the bed. &#8220;I ought never to have
brought you to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you before,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;when
you were sick and sorry. You brought me, years
and years ago, but I&#8217;m older now and I don&#8217;t
mean to stay any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will Monsieur Prosper say when he
knows it? He expects great things of you now
the troupe&#8217;s broken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad it&#8217;s gone to pieces,&#8221; half savagely remarked
the youngster. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any more
of that. What&#8217;s more, I won&#8217;t pick pockets or
cheat at cards, or that sort of thing, for old Prosper
or you either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! alas!&#8221; came from the bed, but whether
in repentance or disappointment it would be hard
to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the boy, in a tone of quiet determination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been Jack Chills long enough;
tell me what my real name is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear nephew&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re really my uncle, you must know, and
if you won&#8217;t tell, I&#8217;ll empty the ice water all over
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And kill me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it won&#8217;t kill you, but it&#8217;s awful cold,&#8221;
said the boy, as he advanced towards the bed with
a large pitcher in his hand. &#8220;Come, now, I must
be off before sunrise. Don&#8217;t tell me any whopper
now. Out with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; burst in half-frightened accents from the
helpless red-face; but then a very different look
began to creep across it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnaby Vernon, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that my name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was your father&#8217;s before you, and you&#8217;re
coming out just like him. I reckon it&#8217;s that that
fetches me now. Bar Vernon, if you make
me one promise, I&#8217;ll be fair with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that I know my own name, I&#8217;ll promise
anything,&#8221; excitedly exclaimed Barnaby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then&mdash;quick now, listen, before I change
my mind&mdash;you see that little black valise?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&#8220;Seen it a thousand times,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s yours, but you must promise not to
open it for a year and a day. I&#8217;ll be either dead
or a thousand miles from here then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely dead,&#8221; growled Bar, who evidently
bore small affection to his big relative. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
promise. Will it tell me anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything; but, Barnaby, not for a year and
a day! You always kept your word, just like
your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep it,&#8221; said Bar, firmly, &#8220;and now, good-bye,
Major Montague, if that&#8217;s your name&mdash;only it
isn&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t say I forgive you exactly, but we&#8217;ll
part friends. No more acrobat and juggling and
tight-rope and wonderful performances for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;ll you do? &#8217;Twon&#8217;t be long before
you&#8217;ll be hunting me up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess not,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;My clothes are pretty
good, and I&#8217;ve collected my last six months&#8217; wages
out of the money you gave me when you came in
last night. There&#8217;s a receipt for it, and there&#8217;s
the rest of the money. You&#8217;ll find it all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wages? Receipt? Jack Chills!&#8221; almost
screamed Major Montague.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I&#8217;ve stopped working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for nothing and being knocked down for it;
good-bye, old fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Barnaby Vernon, for he somehow
felt safe about so calling himself, picked up a very
well-filled leather traveling bag with one hand and
the mysterious little valise with the other, and
started for the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Chills! Barnaby! Come back with
that money! I&#8217;ll have you arrested! I&#8217;ll strangle
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that noise,&#8221; replied Bar, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll douse
you all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnaby!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, then if I must!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby had put down the valise and caught up
the pitcher, and the voice of the man on the bed
died away in a wretched sort of shivering whine
as the chilly flood came swashing down upon
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How he does hate water,&#8221; muttered Bar, as he
again seized his new-found property, and glided
out into the passageway. Neither voice nor pursuing
feet came after him, for Major Montague
was struggling frantically, like a man with the
hydrophobia, to divest himself of his saturated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
habiliments, and his rum-destroyed strength was
by no means equal to the task.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what rum&#8217;ll do if it gets a fair hold of
a man,&#8221; said Barnaby to himself, on the stairs.
&#8220;He must have been a gentleman once, and look
at him now! None of it for me. I don&#8217;t like
that kind of an ending, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped into the bar-room office on the
first floor, for he had no intention of &#8220;sneaking,&#8221;
but not a soul was there, and in another moment
he was in the deserted, gloomy, sordid-looking
street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of time,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to start fair. I must go to my hotel from
the ferry, in the regular coach with the passengers
from the Philadelphia morning train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby Vernon had taken his lesson of life in
a hard school, thus far, and he had done an
amount of thinking for himself which does not
often fall to the share of boys of his age. He
knew very well that no questions would be asked
of a &#8220;regular passenger&#8221; who looked well, and
who brought his baggage with him.</p>

<p>Two hours later, he came out from breakfast at
a respectable, but not too expensive hotel, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
other side of the city, as quiet and self-possessed
a young fellow as the sharp-eyed clerk had
ever seen in his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if he knew his own business, and
meant to mind it,&#8221; was the sufficient commentary
of the latter.</p>

<p>If any of the sharpers who lie in wait for the
young and unwary set his eyes on Barnaby that
morning, he speedily took them off again, for his
instincts must have told him plainly, &#8220;Not a cent
to be made out of that fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under Barnaby&#8217;s external composure, however,
there was more than a little of inner fermentation.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, so far,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;The
old rascal will take it for granted that I&#8217;ve left
the city. Once his penitent fit is over, he&#8217;ll be
sure to go for me again. I ain&#8217;t half sure but
what I&#8217;d better go to Europe or California, only
a hundred dollars isn&#8217;t quite enough for that.
What&#8217;ll I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was not so unwise as to spend his time
around the hotel, however, and he carried his
mental puzzle with him on two or three short
trips on the Sound steamers and up the Hudson.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a name of my own,&#8221; he said to himself,
as he returned to his hotel from the last of
these, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve got rid forever of that horrible
old time, but what shall I do with my &#8216;New
Time&#8217;? I must settle that before my funds run
out. They&#8217;d last longer in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt of that, but what was he to do in
the country?</p>

<p>There had been work enough cut out for him
in town, of a kind that he knew how to go about,
and very remarkable had been the discussion
thereof by the bedside of &#8220;Major Montague,&#8221;
some three or four hours after Barnaby&#8217;s escapade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might set the police after him, on account of
that money,&#8221; said a tall, thin, foreign-looking
man, in a tone of deep dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police, Prosper?&#8221; exclaimed the major.
&#8220;I guess not. The less you say to them the
better. They understand your kind of French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d make a better hand than any of us, in
time,&#8221; groaned Prosper.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s cut his stick, though, as far as we are
concerned,&#8221; added a third, a dapper little fellow,
who stood by Prosper&#8217;s chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s
gone before he learned too much.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>&#8220;He knows enough now,&#8221; said the major, &#8220;but
I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;ll do us any harm. He isn&#8217;t
any common kind of boy, and we never could
have kept him in hand. I tell you, he&#8217;ll be bossing
a crowd of his own before a great while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I mean to have the use of him for a
while first,&#8221; said Prosper, &#8220;if I can only lay my
hands on him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not try,&#8221; said the major.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may come back of his own accord,&#8221; said
the third man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hold your breath till he does,&#8221; kindly
remarked the major.</p>

<p>It was a doleful sort of conference; and the
high opinion of Barnaby Vernon&#8217;s, <i>alias</i> Jack
Chills&#8217;s, capacity in their peculiar line which that
trio entertained was expressed in language decidedly
too powerful to be reported.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED DUCKING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> about the time that Barnaby Vernon sat
down to his first breakfast at his hotel, old Gershom
Todderley, the fat and crusty miller of
Ogleport, stood, with his hands in his pockets,
halfway between the dam and the sawmill,
jerking wheezy, angry sentences at the head of
his Irish foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister Murphy, I say. Those rascally boys
again. They&#8217;ve put up another spring-board.
Twenty times I&#8217;ve forbidden &#8217;em to bathe in my
pond. Saw it off, sir. Close up. They&#8217;ll be
here again this afternoon. So&#8217;ll I, sir. Saw it
off. We&#8217;ll see, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the wheezy miller put on all the dignity that
he knew how, as he turned away towards his own
breakfast, although the only reply from the
dusty-looking Mr. Murphy was a subdued and
doubtful:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Dade, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll do that same, the day, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>The moment his employer was fairly out of
ear-shot, however, a droll expression crept across
the merry face of the Irishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Dade, an&#8217; I&#8217;m glad the owld curmudgeon
didn&#8217;t know I put it there mesilf. Sure, an&#8217; the
lake&#8217;s betther for &#8217;em, but it&#8217;s a mile away, and
the pond&#8217;s clane and handy. It&#8217;ll spile the fun
for the byes, but ordhers is ordhers. Anyhow,
I&#8217;ll have some fun of me own wid &#8217;em. They&#8217;ll
niver suspect owld Pat of layin&#8217; a thrap for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>It evidently went to the heart of the miller&#8217;s
foreman to spoil fun of any kind, but he went
straightway to the grist-mill for a hand-saw, and
then, after a sharp look around, to be sure that
he was not observed, he made a deep cross-cut on
the under side of the long pine plank which he
had so carefully set for the convenience of the
young bathers of Ogleport.</p>

<p>The cut was close in, towards the frame of the
old flume by which the plank was supported,
and, while no one would have noted or suspected
it, the thin bit of pine remaining on the surface
was not a great deal more than was required to
sustain the weight and apparent &#8220;spring&#8221; of the
plank itself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Pat, as he put away his saw,
&#8220;I hope the first feller that puts his fut on that
same&#8217;ll be a good swimmer. It&#8217;s twinty fate o&#8217;
wather he&#8217;ll drop in, not an inch the less.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Pat&#8217;s scrutiny of the &#8220;surrounding country,&#8221;
keen as it was, had not been as complete as
he imagined.</p>

<p>On the opposite shore of the deep and capacious
mill-pond, where the bulrushes had grown so
thickly up to the edge, and the willows had
matted the sweeping boughs so very densely,
every blackbird had left his perch some ten minutes
earlier.</p>

<p>The birds had been better posted than Pat
Murphy, and knew very well why they had
winged it away so suddenly and unanimously,
but Pat had failed to take the hint. Little he
was thinking of those chattering loafers, the
blackbirds, but every one of them had his own
beady little eye on the stealthy movements of
Zeb Fuller.</p>

<p>Not so very young or so small, either, was
Zeb, only somewhat short and &#8220;stocky&#8221; in
build, and the slight cast in one of his twinkling
gray optics did not at all interfere with the perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with which he squinted through the
willows at what was going on at the spring-board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to saw it off, is he?&#8221; muttered Zeb.
&#8220;Well, Pat Murphy never&#8217;d ha&#8217; done that unless
the old man made him. No, he&#8217;s just a-sawin&#8217;
under it. If that ain&#8217;t mean! Well, no, not exactly
mean, but if Pat reckons he&#8217;ll catch any
of our crowd in that trap, he&#8217;s a sold Irishman,
that&#8217;s all. Soon as he clears out, I&#8217;ll cut around
and give the boys the word. There won&#8217;t one
on &#8217;em set foot on that there plank&mdash;you see if
they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zebedee Fuller was the last boy in the village
to interfere with anything like a practical joke,
and his warning to &#8220;the boys&#8221; did not go beyond
his own particular set.</p>

<p>Still, the way in which the mill and the pond
were watched, that day, was a lesson for the detective
service.</p>

<p>The hour at which old Gersh Todderley started
out in his antiquated buggy, and the hour of his
return, as well as every &#8220;in and out&#8221; of Pat
Murphy himself, were carefully noted by one
youngster or another, nor did the discontented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
blackbirds have a fair show at their willow-tree
perches during all those weary hours of patient
waiting.</p>

<p>At last, as the sun sank lower and lower in the
west, the accustomed time arrived for such of the
village boys as declined the long, hot walk to
the lake, to trouble the smooth waters of the
mill-pond and the unsympathizing soul of Gershom
Todderley.</p>

<p>Pat Murphy was somehow more than usually
busy at the grist-mill; the saw of the sawmill
had been quiet for weeks.</p>

<p>There was really no reason why the boys
should not have had a good time with their
spring-board and the cool, cleansing, refreshing
water&mdash;no reason at all but the dog-in-the-manger
spirit of old Gersh Todderley.</p>

<p>But the accustomed squad of young &#8220;dolphins&#8221;
forbade to come, for some cause or other, and
Pat Murphy came to the north window of the
mill, for the hundredth time, all in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faix,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;it&#8217;s a pity to take
so much throuble as all that for nothing. Sorra
one on &#8217;em&#8217;s showed himself near the pond the
day.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Even as he spoke, however, though he had
turned back to his endless clatter and dust, and
saw it not, the seeming solitude of the pond was
being invaded.</p>

<p>Down the stream, from the bushes that concealed
its winding course through the valley
above, there drifted a clumsy, scow-built punt,
the pride of Zeb Fuller&#8217;s heart, and in it with him
were three of his most trusted friends, for, only
three minutes before, Zeb had been advised by a
trusty scout of a very important and promising
occurrence.</p>

<p>Not only had the miller returned, but he had
been met at his very gate by the Rev. Solomon
Dryer, D. D., Principal of Ogleport Academy,
and the two men were actually approaching
the mill together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Sol hasn&#8217;t anything to do with us in vacation,
boys,&#8221; said Zeb, to his friends, &#8220;and I
move we strip and go right in. We can keep
out in the middle, you know, and they can&#8217;t get
at us. The other boys can keep hid behind the
willows and see the fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road from the miller&#8217;s house gave a good
view of the pond at several points; and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
he and his dignified companion had made half
the distance, they saw such goings on upon the
water as led even the fat and wheezy man of lumber
and flour to double his perspiring pace and
his wrath at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those boys, Doctor! See them? In the
boat! That&#8217;s defiance. On my own pond. Defiance,
sir. What are we coming to? What&#8217;s
your authority worth, or mine? Glad I had the
spring-board cut off. We must see about this, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, my dear sir,&#8221; calmly and frigidly responded
the head of the village institution, &#8220;I
fully sympathize with you, but I think my presence
will be sufficient. I have long been accustomed
to repress these rebellious ebullitions. I
will go with you with pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, sir; knew you would. Stop &#8217;em.
Make my pond a bathing-tub before my very
eyes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, while the lyers-in-wait behind the
willows were half-bursting with envy of their
more fortunate fellow-conspirators in the boat,
the doctor and the miller puffed their consequential
way to the open space on the old flume
frame, between the dam and the sawmill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>What a view that spot commanded of the
peaceful mill-pond and of the audacious iniquity
of those boys!</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer drifted the boat, while the
white-skinned rebels plunged from its rocking
sides and disported themselves boisterously and
undisguisedly in all directions, as if ignorant of
the approach of any authority higher than their
own desire for a good swim.</p>

<p>It was to the last degree tantalizing and irritating,
but, just as Gershom Todderley found breath
to sing out, &#8220;You young rascals!&#8221; his eyes fell
upon the mocking and obnoxious length of the
spring-board, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor, do you see that! I&#8217;ll discharge him!
He hasn&#8217;t cut it off. That Irishman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that what the boys denominate a spring-board?&#8221;
asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, sir. I told Pat Murphy to cut it off
this very morning. They walk out to the end of
that, sir, and tilter up and down, and then jump
into the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no danger of its breaking and drowning
them?&#8221; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drown &#8217;em! Drown so many pickerel,&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the miller. &#8220;No, sir. Hold up a ton,
sir. Why, it&#8217;s clear white pine. Stole it from me,
most likely. Walk out on it. Try it yourself,
Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Oh, no, indeed,&#8221; responded the doctor.
&#8220;That would never do. I weigh very little,
to be sure, but I could not think of such a
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the learned gentleman drew his thin and
wizened form back to its most dignified uprightness,
however, a riotous yell and splash from Zeb
and his friends stirred the blood of the miller to
the very bounds of endurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; shouted Zeb; &#8220;let&#8217;s have a
jump from the board, and show &#8217;em what we can
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The face of the miller grew red, and he actually
drew a long breath as he strode forward.</p>

<p>He knew too well the strength of a two-inch
pine plank to have any misgivings, and, just as a
wild shout rang out from the window of the grist-mill,
and Pat Murphy sprang insanely through it
to the great heap of sour &#8220;bran&#8221; beneath, Gershom
Todderley gave the treacherous wood the
full benefit of his overfed weight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Even then the tough pine held its own for a
step or two.</p>

<p>&#8220;You young rascals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>A wild spreading out of fat arms, a wheezy
shriek of fear, a tremendous splash in the calm,
deep water, and Gershom Todderley had received
the full benefit of Pat Murphy&#8217;s trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boat, boys!&#8221; shouted Zeb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, now, or the old porpoise will drown
himself. Pity we didn&#8217;t bring a harpoon along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Four naked boys were in the boat in less than
no time, and while the Rev. Solomon Dryer
stood on the flume, helplessly opening and shutting
his mouth, without uttering a sound, Zeb and
his heroes pulled vigorously to the rescue. They
would have been there in plenty of time, too, but
Pat Murphy, forgetting, in his conscience-stricken
excitement, that he could not swim a stroke, had
made no pause at the brink, but had gone in, heels
over head, to fish for his employer.</p>

<p>There was double work cut out for Zeb and his
friends, and the willows on the opposite shore
were alive with a chorus which never came from
the throats of blackbirds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>The miller may have been a selfish man, but he
was neither a coward nor a fool, and when, on
coming to the surface for the second time, he
found an oar-blade poked into his well-covered
ribs, he had quite sense enough to cling to it and
be pulled to the side of the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;You&#8217;ll tip us over if
you try to climb in. You&#8217;re safe enough, now,
and we&#8217;ll pull you ashore. I&#8217;m going for poor
Pat Murphy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pat was by no means so easy to manage, but in
a couple of minutes more the boys had him upon
the other side of the boat, making a very good
counterpoise for the miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Dr. Dryer,&#8221; exclaimed Zeb, &#8220;we&#8217;re
only waiting for you. You needn&#8217;t stop to strip.
Neither Pat nor old Todderley did. Come right
in. Water&#8217;s nice and cool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young man,&#8221; solemnly remarked the doctor,
&#8220;your levity is most reprehensible. I hope for
an opportunity of inspiring you with a greater
degree of reverence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;we&#8217;ll let Pat and old Todderley
go. They&#8217;ve had a good ducking. But
we must drown the doctor. It&#8217;s our last chance.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Whether or not the man of learning had any
fears of their carrying out the proposition, it was
received with such a yell of what he deemed irreclaimable
ferocity, that he immediately turned his
stately steppings away from the unhallowed
margin of the mill-pond, and the boys were left
to finish their work of rescue alone.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to pull the boat into shallow
water, where Pat and the miller could find footing
and wade ashore, but Zeb Fuller had got a
new idea in his head.</p>

<p>The miller had been obstinately silent ever
since his bald head rose above the water, and
now Zeb turned upon him reproachfully,
with:</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you, Mr. Todderley, or I&#8217;d never have
believed it. Who&#8217;d have thought such a thing of
you, a deacon in the church! And old Sol Dryer,
too! Setting such a trap as that to drown poor
boys, just for swimming in your pond. What do
you think the village will say to it? What&#8217;ll the
church say! You&#8217;re a poor, miserable sinner, but
you haven&#8217;t the heart to drown boys, like so
many puppies. You fell into your own trap, Gershom
Todderley, and we&#8217;ve returned good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
evil by saving your life. Go home and dry yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark to him! Listen to him, the now!&#8221; exclaimed
Pat, in open admiration. &#8220;Ownly eighteen!
Ownly two winters in a debatin&#8217; society,
and he can lie like that. What a lawyer he&#8217;ll
make one of these days!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the fat old miller stood dripping on the
grassy margin for a moment before he could
gather his wits or breath for anything, but then
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat Murphy, set the boys a new board. A
good strong one. Must have been an awful knot
in that other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it another trap?&#8221; sternly inquired Zeb
Fuller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeb, my boy,&#8221; returned the miller, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
exactly understand it, but I am thankful I wasn&#8217;t
drowned. I think I&#8217;ll go to meeting to-night.
You need it, too, Zeb. You and the boys may
swim all over the pond, all day, summer or winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Gershom,&#8221; replied the incorrigible
Zeb, &#8220;and if you meet old Sol Dryer, tell him to
go to meeting, too. He&#8217;s had a very narrow escape
from drowning.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>&#8220;The young pirate!&#8221; exclaimed Pat. &#8220;Indade,
Mr. Todderley, it&#8217;s home ye&#8217;d betther be goin&#8217;,
an&#8217; I&#8217;d loike a dhry rag or two on me own silf.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miller turned very soberly away, the worst
puzzled man in Ogleport that day, but Zeb was
right when he turned to his companions, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, I reckon it won&#8217;t hurt him. He didn&#8217;t
know it was Pat&#8217;s work, and we must keep the
secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a bit of hurt had come to the miller externally,
and more than a little good internally, but
there were altogether too many boys in that &#8220;secret&#8221;
for it to keep any length of time.</p>

<small>MEETING OLD ASSOCIATES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was nearly a week after the beginning of
Bar Vernon&#8217;s &#8220;new time,&#8221; and he had never enjoyed
anything so thoroughly in all his life, that
he returned to his hotel from one of his pleasure
trips.</p>

<p>By this time he had struck up a sort of an acquaintance
with the clerk, although that gentleman
confessed to himself that he had never before
fallen in with a boy of that age who behaved
so very well and talked so very little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Vernon,&#8221; he said to our hero, that afternoon,
&#8220;there&#8217;s been a gentleman in to see you
twice while you were gone&mdash;a Major Montague.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to hear that,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so? He seems a well got-up, rather fine-looking
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help that,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Claimed to be a relative of yours, and seemed
quite anxious to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&#8220;So he is, I suppose,&#8221; replied our hero, &#8220;but
he&#8217;s a disreputable old fellow, for all that, and I&#8217;m
sure my father would not wish me to have anything
to do with him. Drinks like a fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must say he looks a little on that order,&#8221; remarked
the clerk. &#8220;So we&#8217;re not to put him on
your track?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you can help it,&#8221; said Bar, carelessly.
&#8220;The family doesn&#8217;t recognize him at all, and I
don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar was perfectly sure, in his own mind, that
he was telling the exact truth, but it was the first
mention he had made of father or family, and,
while it made his heart and fingers tingle
very curiously and pleasantly, it did not by any
means diminish the respect with which he was
regarded, for the keen-eyed official was the last
man in the world to be taken in by such a face as
that of Major Montague.</p>

<p>He had read him through and through at a
glance, and had wondered what he could have to
do with a quiet, self-respecting young gentleman
like Barnaby Vernon.</p>

<p>Bar strolled away into the reading-room, muttering
to himself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>&#8220;So he has hunted me up. Saw my name on
the hotel register, most likely. Now, I&#8217;ll have to
get away from this. He&#8217;d be sure to make trouble
for me. Then he belongs to that horrid old time,
and I don&#8217;t want anything to do with it. Somehow,
I feel as if something were about to happen
to me, and I don&#8217;t exactly know what to do with
myself. Guess I&#8217;ll go on an exploring tour, but
I&#8217;ll fix it so none of that set&#8217;ll know me if I come
across &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt there had been something of theatrical
experience in Barnaby&#8217;s &#8220;old time,&#8221; for he
seemed to know precisely what to do.</p>

<p>He walked out of the hotel in a very decent
suit, of which the coat and waistcoat were dark,
and the trousers light-gray, but before he had
gone a block, he had bought and put on a loose
linen duster.</p>

<p>Then at a hat-store he purchased a high black
silk &#8220;stove-pipe,&#8221; to replace the straw he had
been wearing.</p>

<p>At another shop he bought a pair of black-rimmed
glasses. Then a neat mustache appeared
on his upper-lip, a college society pin on his neck-tie,
a little cane in his hand, and thus attired he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
could have passed muster anywhere as a young
collegian of the first water, and even old &#8220;Prosper&#8221;
himself might have passed him without a
suspicion of his identity.</p>

<p>He turned aside after that, from the busier
thoroughfares, for he felt the need of a little
thinking, and quickly found himself sauntering
in front of a gray-stone building, facing an open
square thickly dotted with trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;that&#8217;s the old
University. I wish I knew all the things they
teach there. Never was at school in my life, but
I&#8217;ve picked up a good deal, for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar was only half right.</p>

<p>He had been in a terrible school, indeed, and
had grown to be a remarkable sort of fellow,
simply by refusing to learn the evil part of
the lessons his &#8220;professors&#8221; had tried to teach
him.</p>

<p>Still, he was greatly in need of the other kind
of &#8220;lessons,&#8221; and he felt it bitterly, as he stood
and looked up at the gray stone building.</p>

<p>His attention was suddenly diverted by a loud
exclamation not many paces from him, and he
turned in time to see a shabbily dressed fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
pick up from the sidewalk what seemed to be a
very heavy and well-filled pocketbook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some old trick,&#8221; Bar was saying to himself,
when the stranger turned to him with the pocketbook
in his hand, remarking, furtively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Big find that, sir. Just see how full it is.
No end of bank notes, and all big ones. There&#8217;ll
be a whopping reward offered for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in luck, I should say, then,&#8221; drawled
Bar, in his character of collegian. &#8220;Of course
you&#8217;ll advertise it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, ought to be advertised,&#8221; rattled the
stranger; &#8220;but I can&#8217;t stay to do it. I&#8217;m off for
Boston to-night. Couldn&#8217;t stay on any account.
Tell you what I&#8217;ll do. You look like a gentleman.
Feel sure you&#8217;ll see that the right man
gets it. Square and honest. You take it and
divide the reward. Won&#8217;t be less&#8217;n a hundred,
sure&#8217;s you live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not less than that, certainly,&#8221; drawled Bar.
&#8220;Let me look at it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No right to open it, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; said the
stranger quickly, as Bar poised the pocketbook
in his open hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Private papers, perhaps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
No business of ours, you know. All right, you
give me your Boston address and I&#8217;ll send you
your half soon as I get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Bar slipped the prize into his inside
coat-pocket with a movement so nearly instantaneous
that there was no chance for any interference,
but the stranger&#8217;s countenance fell in spite
of himself as he stammered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, sir, that won&#8217;t do, exactly. I&#8217;m
going on North from Boston. Tell ye what I&#8217;ll
do. You give me fifty dollars down. It&#8217;s good
security for that. You may get five hundred,
for all I know. You keep it all and it&#8217;ll only
cost you fifty. You didn&#8217;t find it, you know.
It was all my luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve got so much as that about
me,&#8221; said Bar, with a quick glance up the
street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty, then. Only be quick about it, or I
shall lose my train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t got forty,&#8221; drawled Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty, then, and that&#8217;s awful low,&#8221; pleaded
the stranger, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirty dollars is a good deal of money to
risk,&#8221; considered Bar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>&#8220;Twenty-five, then. Say twenty, or give me
back the pocketbook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Bar, beaming benignly on the
stranger, through his new spectacles, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
your pocketbook. I&#8217;ve been considering the
matter, and I&#8217;ve decided to turn the property
over to the police authorities. There&#8217;s a policeman
now, just turned the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great oath burst from the lips of the
stranger, which were white with rage and disappointment,
but Bar had buttoned his coat over
the pocketbook and was standing in an attitude
which looked very much as if he had learned it
from a boxing-master.</p>

<p>There was no joke about the approach of the
policeman, however, and one look at his blue coat
and brass buttons seemed quite enough for the
stranger. At all events, he swore another ugly
oath, shook his fist savagely at Bar, and darted
briskly away across the square.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything the matter, sir?&#8221; asked the policeman,
as he stepped quickly up to our hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say,&#8221; drawled Bar, &#8220;but I&#8217;m half inclined
to think that gentleman had improper
designs. I do not like his appearance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
have declined to transact any business with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, sir. Well known&mdash;bad character.
Strangers can&#8217;t be too much on their
guard,&#8221; responded the representative of the law,
as a broad grin spread across his face.</p>

<p>When he had walked on a few steps, however,
he growled to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder what game it was? Anyhow, that
prig in spectacles isn&#8217;t the sort that&#8217;ll be swallowed
whole. Sometimes those green-looking,
respectable chaps knows more&#8217;n we think they
do, and where on earth they can pick it up beats
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Bar Vernon, he turned once more towards
the great thoroughfare, only remarking:</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow don&#8217;t come up to Major Montague.
Now, what&#8217;ll I do with the pocketbook?
It&#8217;s a right good one, and I must see what it&#8217;s
stuffed with.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not difficult to find an out-of-the-way
corner, and Bar quickly satisfied himself that his
prize contained little more than a few coarse
counterfeits, a lot of fanciful advertising cards,
in the shape of bank-notes, and enough wrapping-paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to fill out the pile and make it look
&#8220;rich.&#8221; The book itself was of the best Russia
leather, however, and well calculated to catch the
eye of such a &#8220;greenhorn&#8221; as he had been mistaken
for.</p>

<p>On, now slowly, now hurried by the afternoon
up-town tide of foot-passengers, strolled Barnaby,
until, right in front of one of the busiest retail
commercial establishments, he saw a sudden
flurry in the crowd, and a rapid coming together
as if one spot on the sidewalk had acquired an
overpowering attraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another game?&#8221; asked Bar of himself, but
he pushed his way vigorously through the throng,
nevertheless, as determined as anybody to learn
the meaning of it all.</p>

<p>It was by no means the easiest thing in the
world, for there was really a good deal of excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful fit!&#8221; exclaimed one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fell right flat and began to kick without a
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky for him that Dr. Manning happened
on hand so quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Best doctor in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>A shower of remarks reached Bar&#8217;s ears from
all sides, but he could not divest himself of a
feeling which made him extremely watchful, and
he almost instinctively kept one hand upon his
very worthless prize, as if it contained a fortune.</p>

<p>He was &#8220;two or three deep&#8221; back in the crowd
from the central point where the sufferer was
supposed to be lying, and around him were men
of every sort, seeming pretty closely wedged
in.</p>

<p>Sharp as was the watch which Bar was keeping,
he very nearly missed seeing the deft and
dexterous passage from hand to hand of a wallet
which seemed the very counterpart and image of
the one in his own pocket, but it disappeared in
the capacious outer garment of a tall, thin,
foreign-looking gentleman at his side.</p>

<p>The thought flashed through Bar&#8217;s brain with
a rapidity compared to which lightning is a
stage-coach, and his fingers moved with only less
quickness and with marvelous skill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The weight must be about the same,&#8221; thought
Bar, &#8220;and he&#8217;ll never know the difference. It&#8217;s
splendid fun to have got in on old Prosper himself.
The Major must be inside there somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
No, there go both of them, making off as fast as
they can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a clear and somewhat scornful voice
arose above the rest, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, you wretched fraud. There&#8217;s nothing
at all the matter with you. Don&#8217;t give him
a cent, gentlemen, if that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s after.
He&#8217;s no more in a fit than you and I are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the doctor!&#8221; shouted a somewhat
youthful bystander, but the physician, a tall, fine-looking,
benevolent-faced gentleman, forced his
way to the edge of the sidewalk, sprang into a
carriage which seemed to be waiting for him,
and drove away, with the disgusted air of a professional
man whose sympathies had been imposed
upon.</p>

<p>He had not been deceived, however, except for
the first few moments, by even the admirable
acting of the halfway genteel scamp, who now
picked himself up so sheepishly and sneaked
around the corner amid the jeers of the wayfarers,
just in time to evade the fingers of the police.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a regular put-up job,&#8221; exclaimed Bar,
as he walked away. &#8220;Anyhow, it won&#8217;t be difficult
for me to find out who this thing belongs to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Maybe it&#8217;s the doctor himself, only I can&#8217;t see
how he should have such a thing about him and
push right into a crowd with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar had not seen the doctor&#8217;s carriage pull up
as it did, with the first intimation that a human
being might be in need of his skill, nor could he
know how completely such an affair, in the
first place, and his chagrin at being &#8220;sold,&#8221;
in the second, had driven out of the worthy doctor&#8217;s
mind for the moment all other considerations.</p>

<p>For all that, however, Dr. Manning&#8217;s carriage
was in front of police headquarters in less than
an hour from that time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THREE CONFERENCES AND THEIR RESULTS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were three very important conferences
held that evening.</p>

<p>The first was by Barnaby Vernon with himself.</p>

<p>As he walked down-town, towards his hotel,
off came the mustache, the glasses, the pin, one
after another, and then even the duster was removed
and thrown over his arm.</p>

<p>He had left his straw hat &#8220;to be called for,&#8221;
and now he went into the store and put it on
again, ordering the tall silk hat to be delivered at
the hotel.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, on his return, no perceptible
difference in his exterior, and he had
no fears whatever that Major Montague would
make his appearance very soon.</p>

<p>After supper, however, he retired to his own
room, for a good solid &#8220;think&#8221; over the events
of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;there&#8217;s no sort of question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
about the honesty of it, bad as it would
have looked if anybody had seen me do it. Still
it was a terribly dangerous experiment, and I&#8217;ll
never try anything of the sort again, even to
keep a man from being robbed. I might just
have collared old Prosper, and shouted &#8216;Police!&#8217;
Then it never would have been found on him, and
I&#8217;d have made a fool of myself. But what&#8217;ll I say
to the owner? I won&#8217;t own to any connection
with that gang. We&#8217;ll see about it when the time
comes. Maybe he&#8217;ll be glad enough to get his
money back without asking any questions. Now
for a look at it, and to find out to whom it belongs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door of the room was safely locked and
bolted, and Bar sat down with a strange kind of
a trouble all over him, and drew from his bosom
the treasure of which he had so singularly obtained
possession.</p>

<p>It must have been made at the same shop as
the one left in his hands by the &#8220;pocketbook-dropper&#8221;
that morning, and Bar could not help
wondering whether that baffled swindler would
soon succeed again in rigging up so very taking
a bait.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;ll end his days in the penitentiary,&#8221; muttered
Bar, &#8220;and so&#8217;ll all the rest of &#8217;em. I&#8217;d
rather not go that way, if you please. Hullo!
what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thousand-dollar bills, ten of them. Others of
smaller denominations, comparatively, but all
large. Checks and drafts for ten times as much
more.</p>

<p>Business memoranda and receipts, which, even
to Bar&#8217;s inexperienced eye, were evidently of
great importance, and there could be no manner
of doubt that the whole belonged to Dr. Randall
Manning, the great physician.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad he&#8217;s so rich,&#8221; muttered Bar. &#8220;And to
think of such a man going in to help a poor fellow
that fell in a fit on the sidewalk! How mad
he must have been when he found he had been
cheated! Yes, and what did he say or think
when he found all this among the missing. I
see. That gang played for him on purpose, and
they played it wonderfully well. Hope they&#8217;ll
be happy over their winnings. Why, I shall
hardly dare go to sleep to-night with all this in
my room. Only nobody&#8217;d dream of trying to
rob a boy like me. Not worth robbing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
that&#8217;s a comfort just now. I&#8217;ll go to the doctor&#8217;s
the first thing in the morning. Why not
to-night? It&#8217;s early yet. No, he won&#8217;t be at
home this evening. He&#8217;ll be hunting all over the
city to see if he can get on the track of his property.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby was only half right, and his better
course would have been to go at once, for although
the worthy doctor did employ his evening
till a late hour, too, in the manner the quick-witted
boy had imagined, he was just then at
home and would have been glad enough to welcome
such a visitor as Bar would have been.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bar himself might have had some
chance for a good night&#8217;s sleep, instead of lying
wide awake, as he did, hugging his precious
wallet.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, that night&#8217;s wakefulness, as
the guardian of another man&#8217;s property, with all
the thoughts it brought to the mind of the lonely
and friendless boy, may have been of special service,
and Bar&#8217;s decision may have been for the
best, after all.</p>

<p>At all events, when morning came, Bar had
fully made up his mind as to the course he meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to take, and it was scarcely the same he would
have chosen if he had acted on the spur of the
moment.</p>

<p>The second &#8220;conference&#8221; that evening began
at the same time with Bar&#8217;s, but it did not last
all night.</p>

<p>It was held in the elegantly furnished library of
Dr. Manning, and the parties to it were an
elderly-looking, intellectual-seeming gentleman,
and the doctor himself.</p>

<p>The former was no less a man than Dr. Manning&#8217;s
legal counsel, who had called for a very
different piece of business from the one before
him now.</p>

<p>He had evidently been listening to his client&#8217;s
account of his misfortune, and his face expressed
almost as much indignation as sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Judge,&#8221; urged the doctor, &#8220;I felt
that I ought to take it while I could get it. He
was to go on board the steamer at six o&#8217;clock,
and it seemed like my last chance. He means
to be honest, you know, but he&#8217;s so speculative
and uncertain. He signed over the checks and
drafts, and paid me the money, just as if he had
never intended to do anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&#8220;You could have had him arrested,&#8221; snapped
the judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrested, Judge Danvers? The very thing
I did not want to do. Besides, how could I, when
he turned upon me so frankly and said, &#8216;There&#8217;s
your money just as I collected it, every cent,&#8217;
and paid it squarely into my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No telling what he has that belongs to other
men. You were not his only victim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never thought of that,&#8221; said the doctor.
&#8220;Anyhow, I received my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And lost it on your way home,&#8221; growled the
judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; replied the doctor. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already
sent advertisements to all the newspapers.
The finder could not use the checks and drafts,
even if he were dishonest, and my wallet was
marked inside with my address in full.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Finder!&#8221; petulantly exclaimed the judge.
&#8220;Why, Doctor, you&#8217;ve had your pocket picked.
Do you suppose your reward&mdash;a thousand dollars
I think you said&mdash;will make a pickpocket send
back your greenbacks? Of course, you can stop
payment of the other things, if you&#8217;re quick
enough. I&#8217;ll take care of that myself, but how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
are we ever to get at the money, I&#8217;d like to
know? It&#8217;s a pretty kettle of fish. You say
you took a carriage and rode all the way home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the doctor, almost meekly, &#8220;it
was after bank hours or I&#8217;d have deposited the
whole thing at once. So I took a carriage and
hurried home, meaning to lock it up in my own
safe here, over night, and deposit it in the bank
in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you stop, anywhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;yes&mdash;well, I did get out for just a minute
in front of Stewart&#8217;s, to look at a fellow they
said had tumbled in a fit on the sidewalk. He
was a complete fraud. No fit at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; exclaimed the judge. &#8220;If I could
only get hold of that make-believe epileptic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mean? Why, there was a crowd, of course,
all around you, behind you, close to you, as you
leaned over your patient. The light-fingered
gentry had it all their own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Judge, I saw half a dozen men I knew,
and a more respectable-looking crowd you never
saw. There were even ladies in it, just come out
of Stewart&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said the judge, &#8220;and I must see
the police this very night again, and so must
you. Send for a carriage, Doctor; we&#8217;ve no time
to lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the doctor, as he rose
from his chair, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve three or four patients I
must look to on the way. Mustn&#8217;t neglect
them, you know, for any mere matter of
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patients!&#8221; exclaimed the dry, hard man of
law, but he gazed very admiringly on the true-hearted
and high-principled physician for all
that. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll help you &#8217;tend cases all night.
No other medicine man shall have the killing
of me. To think of them under such circumstances!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so, a few minutes later, the doctor and
the judge rode away together on their joint errand
of healing, mercy, and pickpocket detection.</p>

<p>The third conference had taken place even
earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>Such experienced hands as Prosper, Major
Montague, and their colleagues, were not likely
to come together at once, after such a remarkable
exploit as they had performed, and they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
their way to their appointed rendezvous by circuitous
routes, and one by one.</p>

<p>Moreover, even Prosper, mindful of the suspicious
jealousy of his associates, did not dare
to disturb the outer covering of his prey until
the rest arrived, although his clawlike fingers
worked around it, as it lay in his pocket, with
a perfect ague-shake of mingled greed and curiosity.</p>

<p>The hour agreed upon was not likely to be
overstaid on such an occasion as that, and Prosper
was in no danger of being long compelled to
bear his temptation alone.</p>

<p>First came the little, dapper, sharp-visaged person
who had made so good an imitation of a
fit, then Major Montague, and, closely following
him were two very well dressed, respectable-looking
gentlemen, who had been conspicuous
as active members of the &#8220;crowd&#8221; in front of
Stewart&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, gentlemen,&#8221; said Prosper, &#8220;we are all
here and it may be there&#8217;s no time to lose. We&#8217;ve
made a magnificent haul, or I&#8217;m mistaken. There
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so saying he threw down upon the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
before them the elegantly finished Russia leather
wallet, which Barnaby Vernon had received from
the &#8220;dropper&#8221; a few hours earlier, plump and
full as when Bar had refused to &#8220;divide the reward&#8221;
for it.</p>

<p>The eyes of the whole party glistened with
expectation, and more than one of them drew a
long breath and reached out an involuntary hand.
It was by no means easy for such men to look
upon a pocketbook like that and not lay a finger
on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it, Monsieur Prosper,&#8221; said Major
Montague, dignifiedly. &#8220;Let all witness the opening
and feel sure of the exact justice of our mutual
dealings.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hum of approbation ran around the little
circle as Prosper&#8217;s unsteady fingers drew the
strap and disclosed the precious contents to their
admiring gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; almost instantly thereafter
shouted Major Montague. &#8220;Prosper, you old
villain, do you think you can play any such
game on us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The chorus of wrath, indignation, bitterness,
profanity that followed upon the major&#8217;s &#8220;opening&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
would have defied a dozen stenographers,
and poor old Prosper bent tremblingly and
helplessly before the storm, vainly protesting
the truth that the wallet had not left his
pocket until he laid it before them on the table.</p>

<p>No such assertion could be of any manner
of service. Were they all fools? Had Dr.
Manning rigged himself for the drop game?
What had he done with the money?</p>

<p>And then came darker hints and threats, until
Prosper, almost beside himself with rage, fear,
and perplexity, actually stuck his head out of the
open window and yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Police! police!&#8221; at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>The room behind him was empty in a moment,
but Bar Vernon&#8217;s afternoon work had resulted
in forever disbanding what had threatened,
from the skill and ability of its well-trained
membership, to be one of the most dangerous
gangs of rogues that ever infested the metropolis.</p>

<p>Prosper knew that he would thenceforth be a
marked man, even among the thieving fraternity
itself, and could hope for no more confederates.</p>

<p>The major had lost faith in humanity, and
knew, besides, that all humanity had lost faith in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
him, for it was more than intimated that he was
suspected of collusion with Prosper.</p>

<p>The little dapper &#8220;fits&#8221; imitator declared that
he had lost all ambition, and should at once
return to his legitimate business of three-card
monte.</p>

<p>As for the other two, they contented themselves
for weeks with a vain attempt to dog the
movements of their late associates, and learn
what had become of the doctor&#8217;s money.</p>

<p>The only man who made any profit out of the
operation was the landlord of the &#8220;hotel,&#8221; who
found the wallet lying on the table after Prosper&#8217;s
half-frenzied exit, and sold it to a countryman
for three dollars, applying that sum to the
rent of the room.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bitterest moment undergone by
any of them all, however, came to the share of
Prosper himself, the next morning, when he
read in the papers an offer of a thousand dollars&#8217;
reward for the return of that very wallet.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, he bowed his head in utter desolation,
for the truth became only too clear to a
mind so well trained as his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Changed in the crowd!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>&#8220;Got into the wrong hands. Somebody else
will get the reward or keep the wallet!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was too much for human endurance, and
for at least an hour the defeated pickpocket had
serious thoughts of giving up everything and
going to work for an honest living.</p>

<p>It looked a good deal as if even the evil one had
turned against him, which is very much what
every evil man is apt to make up his mind to,
sooner or later.</p>

<small>ZEB&#8217;S OPINION OF APPLE SPROUTS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Zebedee,</span> my son,&#8221; remarked old Deacon
Fuller to that young gentleman, when he returned
from driving the cows to pasture, the
evening after the affair at the spring-board&mdash;&#8220;Zebedee,
what is this I hear of your violent
threats against the Rev. Dr. Dryer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The deacon was standing in the kitchen doorway,
deliberately stripping the leaves from a
handful of strong, well-grown apple-tree &#8220;suckers,&#8221;
which he had recently gathered in the
orchard back of the house.</p>

<p>For a moment Zeb stood in silence, eying the
ominous-looking sprouts with a squint in which a
very grave expression was beginning to make its
appearance, and his father continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Dryer has been here, himself, and he
tells me you employed the most disrespectful and
threatening language.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, father,&#8221; said Zeb, stoutly, &#8220;no disrespect
at all. I only wanted to drown him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>&#8220;Drown him! Zebedee! Drown Dr. Dryer?
Are you crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit, father; it might be bad for him&mdash;just
a little&mdash;but think what a splendid thing it
would be for the Academy. We&#8217;ll never get rid
of him any other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deacon Fuller was a parent of the genuine old
Puritanic stock, and his weather-beaten face
could put on all the iron sternness of his race and
breeding, but behind every visage of that kind
there is a strangely mellow something, and he
was Zeb&#8217;s father. Not a muscle quivered, but
his only reply for a moment was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;did old Sol tell you the
whole story? If he didn&#8217;t I think I&#8217;d better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be just,&#8221; remarked the deacon,
and Zeb was in the middle of it before he had
time to reconsider his opinion.</p>

<p>The story was not likely to lose much in Zeb&#8217;s
telling of it, and before it was half finished the
deacon began to feel as if there was no other
duty in the world so difficult to live up to as a
wholesome degree of parental severity.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment, indeed, and Deacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Fuller felt as if a powerful reinforcement had
arrived when, just then, the front gate swung
open and the pursy form of Gershom Todderley,
the miller, came heavily up the path to the side
of the house where Zeb and his sire were
standing.</p>

<p>Brief, indeed, and somewhat embarrassed, were
the mutual greetings, but Deacon Fuller&#8217;s face
was fast recovering its original rigidity, in spite
of the pictures in his mind&#8217;s eye of old Gershom
going off the broken spring-board.</p>

<p>Zeb never yielded an inch of ground, and
fairly astounded his father by holding out his
hand with:</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to be hurt a bit. I thought
a good swim wouldn&#8217;t do you any harm. I take
one every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeb,&#8221; exclaimed the miller, &#8220;I mean to learn
to swim. Deacon Fuller, he&#8217;s an odd boy.
Saved my life this afternoon. Made a fool of
myself. Came over to thank you, soon as I
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Made a fool of yourself? Came to thank
me? Why, neighbor Todderley, what do you
mean? Some of Zeb&#8217;s performances, I suppose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
I was just going to have a settlement with him.
Dr. Dryer was here an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old fool,&#8221; exclaimed the miller, with some
energy. &#8220;Wish he&#8217;d tried the board first.
Lighter man than I am. Might not have broke
with him. Hope it might. Stood there like a
post. Never tried to help me. Zeb and the
boys fished me out. Came to thank you and
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the deacon, with a greatly relieved
sigh, &#8220;that&#8217;s it, is it? I thought it must all be
some of Zeb&#8217;s mischief. Come in, brother Todderley,
come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank ye,&#8221; replied the miller. &#8220;Got an
errand up street. Hope I&#8217;ll see you at meeting.
Solemn thing to be drowned. Good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the miller turned on his heel, but Zeb&#8217;s
father once more bent his inquiring gaze upon
his hopeful son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee, that&#8217;s all very well, but what&#8217;s this
about Dr. Dryer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gersh Todderley&#8217;s right about him too,&#8221; said
Zeb. &#8220;I&#8217;ve the greatest respect for his opinions,
now&#8217;s he&#8217;s in his right mind. Glad he means to
learn to swim. I wouldn&#8217;t mind teaching him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
myself. They say fat men float the easiest
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee, I hardly know what course I ought
to take.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s face was again putting on a grave
and serious look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; he said, pointing at the apple-tree
sprouts, &#8220;what are those things for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you ought to know by this time, my
son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes,&#8221; said Zeb, quietly, &#8220;I had some
pretty good lessons years ago. May be it was
just as well, too. But, father, how old am I
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen, Zeb. Why do you ask such a
question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eighteen!&#8221; slowly repeated Zeb. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you think of anything better than apple-tree
suckers for a boy of eighteen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee!&#8221; exclaimed the astonished deacon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just thought I&#8217;d ask the question,&#8221; said
Zeb, with a twinkle in his gray eyes which may
not have been altogether fun. &#8220;Sprouts get to
be trees, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And bear apples, and save men&#8217;s lives&mdash;yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and teach lessons to their own fathers,&#8221; exclaimed
the deacon, as he threw the whole handful
of rods over the nearest fence. &#8220;I was mistaken,
Zeb. Go in and see your mother. I&#8217;m
going to meeting. And&mdash;Zeb&mdash;I don&#8217;t want
any tree in my orchard to bear worthless apples.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb went on into the house and his father out
at the gate. It may be that both of them
strongly suspected how completely every word
had been drunk in by the listening, loving ears
of good old Mrs. Fuller.</p>

<p>They owed a good deal to her, those two,
father as well as son, and she had never looked
with much favor on the apple-tree sprouts. Not,
at least, since Zebedee reached his first very mischievous
&#8220;&#8217;teens.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little danger that the orchard would
ever again be drawn upon for Zeb&#8217;s benefit.</p>

<p>The occurrences of the day, however, had
been by no means private property.</p>

<p>Not only the crew of Zeb&#8217;s boat, but the
half-score of lyers-in-wait behind the willows had
vigorously distributed varying versions of the
affair, and the Rev. Dr. Solomon Dryer had
aided them more than a little.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>The latter, indeed, had found &#8220;company&#8221;
awaiting him on his return home, and he had delivered
the history of the dangers from which he
had escaped to a half roomful of sympathizing
auditors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drown you!&#8221; exclaimed his better-half,
through her firmly clinched false teeth&mdash;that is,
if a man&#8217;s third wife can fairly be considered so
large a fraction of him as that&mdash;&#8220;drown you, my
dear? Did the young ruffians go so far as
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point, however, the solemn-visaged
matron was interrupted by a merry, ringing
peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Euphemia Dryer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Effie, my own daughter! To think of your
discerning, in such a matter, any sufficient occasion
for levity!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither the doctor&#8217;s third wife nor the doctor
himself seemed capable of expressing their astonishment,
but the laughter was cut short with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa, I didn&#8217;t mean anything naughty,
but I was thinking how funny it must have
seemed to see old Mr. Todderley plump into the
pond in that way. And how he and Pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Murphy must have looked when they were
pulled out. It&#8217;s too funny for anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, for poor Effie, her rosy face and her
mirth were both ordered out of the parlor, for
Mrs. Dryer discerned that the latter had spread
with dreadful rapidity among her guests.</p>

<p>Even then, however, Effie had no sooner disappeared
than Mrs. Dryer kindly apologized for
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young and giddy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and so
thoughtless, just like her poor mother, the doctor&#8217;s
second, you know. She frequently loses
control of her risible faculties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing!&#8221; remarked one of the ladies.
&#8220;But what a very sweet face she has, and such a
dear, pleasant way of laughing! You must find
her quite a treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said another. &#8220;Girls will be
girls. Mine are all so fond of Effie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to find it difficult to reproduce
the subject of Zeb Fuller&#8217;s enormity, but
that was nothing to the effort it cost his wife
to smile and look sweet while her visitors were
praising her stepdaughter.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that Effie&#8217;s tea-time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a troubled one, but there were reasons why she
was in no danger of unendurable severity just
then, if she was as yet &#8220;under age&#8221; and capable
of seeing the funny side of things.</p>

<p>After tea, the doctor had a brief call to make
at Deacon Fuller&#8217;s, from which he returned with
a serene assurance that the young assailant
of his dignity was not to escape without just and
ample retribution, for he had seen, with his own
eyes, the stern and exemplary father proceeding
to the orchard for the necessary appliances.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; muttered the doctor, as he
turned his steps once more homeward, &#8220;only I
think hickory would be better in a case of this
magnitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>What would have been his feelings if he had
witnessed the ignominious after-fate of even the
&#8220;sprouts&#8221; he deemed so inadequate to the occasion?</p>

<p>But, then, Zeb Fuller was just as well satisfied.</p>

<small>BARNABY CALLS ON THE DOCTOR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bar Vernon</span> was particularly anxious not to
miss the doctor that next morning, if only because
the precious wallet was becoming such
a dreadful burden to carry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t sleep with that thing another
night,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;not for the whole
hotel,&#8221;&mdash;forgetting how very little slumbering
he had really managed to do.</p>

<p>His anxiety, however, led him into a very
judicious piece of extravagance. He could not
think of either losing time or exposing himself to
any perils by the way; and so he called the first
good-looking &#8220;hack&#8221; carriage he saw empty
after leaving the hotel, and was whirled up
in front of Dr. Manning&#8217;s elegant &#8220;brown-stone
front,&#8221; on one of the most fashionable up-town
streets, in something like proper style.</p>

<p>For all that, however, the dignified servant
who answered Bar&#8217;s pull at the door-bell looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
down a little loftily on so very young and
healthy-looking a &#8220;patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Manning does not wish to see any one
this morning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that,&#8221; interrupted Bar. &#8220;He is
waiting for me. Just give him my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Card, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No card,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Just tell him my name
is Wallet, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thoroughly mystified porter politely
showed Bar into the doctor&#8217;s reception-room and
stalked away to the library with his message.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wallet? Wallet?&#8221; muttered the doctor,
when he received it. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know any such
man. Did he say what was the matter with
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said as how you were waitin&#8217; for him, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiting for him? Wallet? Ah, yes, I see.
How I wish Judge Danvers were here! John,
go over for the judge at once. Tell him I want
to see him immediately. Show Mr. Wallet in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In here, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, right away. Say to the judge it&#8217;s very
important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Manning, on advice of his counsel, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
kept his loss of the night before, a secret from
everybody but his wife, and the dignified porter
had not the slightest idea of the tremendous
meaning which might be lurking under the very
simple name of the &#8220;cheeky&#8221; visitor.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the sort of human
being which the doctor had pictured to himself
as likely to come on such an errand, he was
manifestly astonished when our hero was ushered
into the library.</p>

<p>&#8220;John&#8221; would have given something to have
&#8220;fussed around&#8221; and learned a little more, but
his master peremptorily hurried him off.</p>

<p>He had asked Bar to be seated, almost mechanically,
but, as the door closed on John, he
turned to him again with,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Wallet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There I am,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;all of me you care
for, lying on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>There it was, sure enough, in all the glory of
its Russia leather, and the good doctor drew a
long sigh of relief as he picked it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could I have lost it?&#8221; he said to himself,
aloud. &#8220;The judge is clearly wrong about
it. May I ask where you found it, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&#8220;Vernon,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;The visitor you were
waiting for was named Wallet. I&#8217;m only
Barnaby Vernon. Please count your money,
Doctor, and see that all the papers are there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; exclaimed the good doctor, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
no doubt of that, my young friend; there is that
in your face which assures me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Doctor,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;that pocketbook kept
me awake all night, for fear you might miss
something when you opened it. Please count it
over; I shan&#8217;t be easy till you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy&#8217;s face assumed a wonderfully earnest
expression as he spoke, and the doctor looked at
his fresh, yet strongly-marked young face most
benevolently, as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the judge would say you are right.
No man should let money go out of his hand
without a receipt, he says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m waiting for,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I remember,&#8221; said the doctor, as he
drew the strap and began to turn over the contents
of the wallet; &#8220;a receipt and something
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar was silent, but Dr. Manning had now recovered
his hitherto somewhat disturbed equilibrium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and he was now examining his recovered
treasure as carefully as if he were noting the
symptoms of a difficult &#8220;case,&#8221; and that is saying
a good deal.</p>

<p>&#8220;All there,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;Every paper.
Every cent. Not a thing missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please make me out a receipt in full, then,&#8221;
said Barnaby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Receipt!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor, as he took
up a pen and a scrap of paper. &#8220;Certainly.
One of those thousand dollar bills is yours, too.
There it is. But I wish you would tell me now
where you found it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish
any reward. Find it? Oh, no, Doctor, I stole
it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stole it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there came a violent ring at the
door-bell, and Dr. Manning exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the judge, now. I&#8217;m ever so glad
he&#8217;s come.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment more the keen, penetrating eyes
of the old lawyer were busily reading, with
practiced skill, every line and shade on the face
of Barnaby Vernon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>&#8220;The money and papers are all right,&#8221; remarked
the doctor, &#8220;but our young friend refuses
to take any reward or to tell me how he
came by the wallet. He says he stole it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stole it!&#8221; almost shouted the judge. &#8220;Stole
it from the man who found it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;One man found it in
Dr. Manning&#8217;s pocket. He gave it away to another
man, at once, and he to another, and he to
another way back in the crowd. I stole it from
that man&mdash;or rather, for I was honest about it, I
traded him another wallet for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a deep one,&#8221; exclaimed the judge.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better have you arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said Bar, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest him!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor. &#8220;What
for, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For bringing back your pocketbook,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, young man,&#8221; said the lawyer,
half apologetically, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that, exactly.
But it&#8217;s all very strange. Don&#8217;t you think you
deserve any reward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;it&#8217;s cost me a deal of
trouble and worry, besides my carriage-hire this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>&#8220;Why won&#8217;t you take it, then?&#8221; asked the
puzzled doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask something better than an
arrest,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said the judge, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take that
all back. I never was so interested in anything
in all my life. What is it you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;except a little advice,
and so I brought my fee with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Advice!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor. &#8220;Why,
you look about the stoutest, healthiest fellow of
your age I&#8217;ve seen in a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but I want advice, nevertheless.
You see, I&#8217;ve heard that you doctors
are the only men living that can keep a secret,
and I can&#8217;t get the advice I want without telling
mine. So as soon as the judge is gone I&#8217;ll tell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little the coolest!&#8221; growled the old
lawyer. &#8220;Why, young man, doctors are no more
professional secret-keepers than we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the doctor owes me a fee, a big one, and
you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take
the judge in as counsel. I&#8217;ll pay his fee if he
asks for one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s fee enough,&#8221; exclaimed the judge.
&#8220;Never saw anything like him. Don&#8217;t let him
send me away, Doctor. Look here, young man,
it may be you want a lawyer more&#8217;n you do a
doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;and I s&#8217;pose a fellow&#8217;s
own counsel is bound to side with him?
Have you time now, or shall I call again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call again?&#8221; shouted the judge. &#8220;Do you
want me to burst? Out with it, now? How
did you come by that wallet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby&#8217;s mind had been at work all night on
what he meant to say that morning, and it never
occurred to him as strange that those two elderly
men should get so excited with curiosity as they
now clearly were. He had struggled so long
with the important question &#8220;what should he do
with himself,&#8221; that he felt he must ask somebody,
and surely two such men as these ought to
be able to tell him. His next words were, therefore:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, if you&#8217;ll keep my secret for me,
I&#8217;ll begin at the beginning&mdash;it isn&#8217;t long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not long. Only the outline story of such a
life as he remembered, with Major Montague and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
old Prosper, in every part of the country, and in
all sorts of curious and often doubtful undertakings.</p>

<p>Then his own growing conviction that he had
been born for something better, his final rebellion
and his setting out for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that black valise!&#8221; exclaimed the judge.
&#8220;What did you find in that? You say you remember
some sort of home and family when you
were very young. Did you find anything about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t opened it yet,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;You
know, I said to you, I promised Major Montague
I wouldn&#8217;t open it for a year and a day. I must
keep my word, even if he was ever so drunk
when I gave it to him. If he&#8217;d been sober I&#8217;d
never have known anything about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your word! What do you think of
that, Doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think?&#8221; exclaimed the doctor, brushing his
benevolent old eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, too,&#8221; continued Bar, &#8220;it was that
gang found your wallet in your pocket, and I
stole it from Prosper in the crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few words more explained Bar&#8217;s operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
more fully, but he absolutely refused to have
anything to do with the &#8220;prosecution&#8221; the judge
began to talk of.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;He&#8217;d have to
give testimony that would harm him wrongfully&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; began the judge; &#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar interrupted him with:</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, gentlemen, the whole of it is just
this. I&#8217;ve got a new name, I want a new life,
and you must advise me how to get into it.
That&#8217;ll be worth more to me than any one thousand
dollars&#8217; reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to think of such a boy seeing it in that
light,&#8221; exclaimed the judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; said the Doctor, &#8220;you seem to be all
at sea. This looks like a case for me to treat.
In a year from now he can open his valise, for I
think he must keep his promise to his rascally
uncle, and then we can&#8217;t guess what he may
learn. Meantime he must go to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;School!&#8221; exclaimed Bar. &#8220;How am I to
manage that? My money&#8217;s half-gone already.
I must find a way of earning some
more.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of that,&#8221; began the judge, with
sudden energy; but the doctor interposed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Judge. My boy goes back to
Ogleport Academy in a couple of weeks or so,
and our young friend must go with him. He
must let me pay at least a year&#8217;s schooling on account
of the thousand dollars&#8217; reward. He&#8217;s
saved me ten thousand, to say the least. A good
deal more, I&#8217;m afraid. It&#8217;ll be just the place for
him, and his old scoundrel of an uncle will never
think of hunting for him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; shouted the judge; &#8220;only you
must count me in, somewhere. My young friend,
maybe my turn&#8217;ll come when that valise is opened.
It may be chock full of law business, for all you
know. Hullo, the boy&#8217;s crying!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fact, though it did not long continue
so. Poor Bar&#8217;s anxieties and excitements, with
the task of detailing his sufferings and adventures,
crowned as all had been by such a wonderful
result, had been too much for him. With
all his hardly acquired keenness and self-possession,
Bar Vernon was only a boy, after all, and
he was altogether unused to such treatment as
he was now receiving. Besides, the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
going to school, of all things, and in the country,
and in decent company, such as he longed for&mdash;it
was too much indeed, and Bar had covered
his face with his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the doctor; &#8220;but now,
Judge, I must see all this stuff safely deposited in
bank, this time; I shan&#8217;t be easy till I&#8217;ve done
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I won&#8217;t leave you till you do,&#8221; said the
Judge. &#8220;But how about Barnaby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage I came in is still at the door,&#8221;
said Bar, looking up; &#8220;you might ride down in
that and leave me at the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;And
then I can call for you on my way back, and
bring you right up here. No more hotel for you,
my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar felt very much like going on with his cry,
but the two old gentlemen were in a hurry, and
in a few moments more the dignified porter almost
broke his neck looking after the carriage as
it carried off that trio. It was barely an hour
later that the clerk of the hotel, after bowing
most respectfully to the great physician, was
electrified by his inquiring for Mr. Vernon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know he was sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick? No, indeed,&#8221; replied the doctor.
&#8220;He&#8217;s coming up to visit with my boy for awhile.
Send up for him, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Youngster&#8217;s all right, after all,&#8221; muttered
the clerk to himself, &#8220;but that villainous looking
Major Montague was here for him again this
morning. Anyhow, he&#8217;s in good hands now.
Wonder who his father is?&#8221;</p>

<p>That was just the puzzle that was troubling
the mind of our hero, and the doctor, and even
the busy old judge himself, all the rest of that
long, hot August day, and the little black valise
never said or hinted a single word to relieve
them.</p>

<small>HUNTING THE COWS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> pretty village was Ogleport, stuck
away off there in that fertile valley among the
hills. Mountains these latter grew into within a
few miles, with ravines and rocky gorges instead
of valleys, and beyond them was the great, mysterious,
rugged wilderness, with its tall peaks
and its forests full of wild animals.</p>

<p>Excellent people were those of Ogleport, with
no small opinion of their village and themselves,
and their &#8220;Academy&#8221; was their especial
pride.</p>

<p>There it stood, in the middle of the great,
tree-bordered &#8220;village green,&#8221; while on either
hand of it were the &#8220;meeting houses&#8221; of the
half-dozen denominations among which the people
of Ogleport and the surrounding country
were divided.</p>

<p>A large, steeple-crowned structure of wood,
painted white, with the staring windows of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
two lofty stories unshaded by any such nonsensical
things as blinds, the Academy had evidently
been planned by the same architect who had
designed the church building, and it was as sober
and ugly-looking as any of them.</p>

<p>Back of the row of meeting houses and the
Academy were long, shadowy rows of ample
sheds, for the accommodation of the teams and
wagons of the country people on Sundays, and
back of that again was the badly kept and
tangled-looking &#8220;graveyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those sheds were great places for the conclaves
of the &#8220;boys&#8221; of Ogleport, but their larks
rarely carried them, even in broad daylight, beyond
or through or over the shattered picket
fence of the graveyard.</p>

<p>Not that they were particularly superstitious,
but then, as a general thing, they deemed it just
as well to &#8220;go around,&#8221; and it was, indeed, a
queer place to get into alone after sundown.</p>

<p>If, however, the boys had any reverence for
the bit of land where the village buried its dead,
they had none whatever for the big, white building
where they were themselves compelled to
bury so much of the valuable time they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
otherwise have usefully employed in fishing,
hunting, and other matters of equal importance.</p>

<p>The benches of the several rooms, not excepting
those of the &#8220;chapel&#8221; or lecture-room in the
rear, or the great hall in the second story, the
frames of the doors, the pine wainscoting, the
desks, every reachable piece of wood about the
whole concern was notched and scarred by the
sharp and busy knives of the boys of Ogleport.</p>

<p>More than one busy man, there and elsewhere,
if he ever came back again on a visit, could trace
his deeply-cut initials, three times painted over,
among the innumerable scars of that institution
of learning.</p>

<p>Zeb Fuller&#8217;s generation had done at least their
share of this particular kind of improvement,
and the oldest inhabitants of the village freely
declared their opinion that there had never been
such a lot of unreclaimed young savages since
the Indians cleared out.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were right, and then again perhaps
they had forgotten something, but the boys
did not trouble their minds much about it, either
way.</p>

<p>Still, it was a great comfort to the Rev. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Solomon Dryer to meet with so liberal an
amount of human sympathy, especially as it had
helped him that summer to carry into effect his
design of securing an additional assistant.</p>

<p>There had always been Mrs. Ross with two or
three ambitious young ladies to help her in the
male department, and a long and variegated line
of &#8220;young men preparing for college,&#8221; who had
acted for the time being as &#8220;tutors&#8221; under Dr.
Dryer, but never before had the Academy trustees
ventured on the outlay required for a full-grown,
thoroughly educated, competent man to
do the doctor&#8217;s heavy work for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps a certain feeling of jealousy on the
doctor&#8217;s part; a dread of having any second person
so near his own throne of authority, had had
something to do with it; but now there had
appeared a new element of danger which he
found himself compelled to meet.</p>

<p>Some mischievous friend and patron of the
Academy, mindful, perhaps, of how much he had
done towards whittling down the old building,
had made it a present of a very complete set of
chemical and other instructive apparatus, and
what Dr. Dryer himself would do with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
new-fangled trash was a good deal more than he
could tell.</p>

<p>And so&mdash;and so&mdash;there had been no end of
solemn talk about it, but the new assistant had
been hired, and was to begin his labors with the
fall term, soon to begin.</p>

<p>An additional feather in the cap of Dr. Dryer
had been the fact that an unusually large number
of &#8220;boarders&#8221; was expected. That is, boys
from a distance, who were to find homes among
the villagers and drink in daily wisdom at the
Academy.</p>

<p>Some were to come from even the great city,
where the men all know so much and the boys
were all so ignorant and so wicked, but wore
such good clothes and paid their bills so
promptly.</p>

<p>Zeb and his crowd were by no means unaware
of all these things, and one of the curious results
of the spring-board business was that it set Zeb
to thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he sets his face against me and won&#8217;t let
me come in,&#8221; said Zeb, to himself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll miss all
the new experiments. Besides, I really want to
study some. There is a good deal in books. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
wonder if we couldn&#8217;t coax the new man to put
us into a course of Scott&#8217;s Novels and history?
Wonder if he&#8217;ll be got up on the same plan as
old Sol? Pity him if he is, that&#8217;s all. Tell you
what, I must manage to get straight with the
doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Zeb wandered off&mdash;for it was the
very morning after the miller&#8217;s dip in the pond&mdash;down
to the mill-dam.</p>

<p>When he got there, he found Pat Murphy just
finishing up a piece of work into which he had
put all his heart for an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;New spring-board, eh?&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;Now
go and get your saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what for should I do that same?&#8221;
asked Pat.</p>

<p>&#8220;To set your drowning trap,&#8221; replied Zeb,
calmly. &#8220;I want to see how you do it. You
cut it three-quarters through, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Zeb, ye spalpeen, get out wid yer nonsense,&#8221;
growled Pat, with a very uneasy expression
on his dusty face. &#8220;The boord&#8217;s all right.
Jist shtrip an&#8217; thry it wanst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;Did you really
mean to murder old Gershom? And now you&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
going to try it again. I&#8217;d never thought that of
you, Pat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;long wid yez!&#8221; laughed the Irishman.
&#8220;Yer at the bottom of all the mischief there is.
I hope there&#8217;ll be young gintlemin from the city,
the now, that&#8217;ll tache ye manners. It&#8217;s waitin&#8217;
for thim, I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drown &#8217;em, shall you?&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;But
what&#8217;ll Gershom say to that? I&#8217;ll have to be
down here in my boat all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe ye one, Zeb Fuller!&#8221; exclaimed Pat,
with a sudden and very warm burst of grateful
recollection. &#8220;Ave yer iver in a schrape and
want a frind, just come to owld Pat Murphy,
that&#8217;s all. It was mesilf didn&#8217;t want to shpile
the fun of yez. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t been on hand it would have
been spoiled pretty badly,&#8221; moralized Zeb. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going for a pull in the boat now, myself. Give
my love to Gershom when he comes, and tell
him he&#8217;s a nice boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>A queer duck was Zeb Fuller, but, by the time
he had floated vaguely up and down the pond
two or three times, he had very fairly matured
his plans for operating upon Dr. Dryer and preventing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the doors of the Academy from being
closed against him.</p>

<p>That day was an unusually busy one for Ogleport,
in vacation-time, for every gossip in the
village had notes to compare with every other,
but Zeb Fuller was among the invisible all day,
and he retired to rest at an hour which gave his
father renewed hopes of the bright future which
lay before his heir.</p>

<p>No pains were taken, however, to ascertain
whether Zeb&#8217;s pillow was constantly occupied
through the night-watches, and all the deacon
was absolutely sure of was, that he had some
difficulty in stirring him up in the morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this, Zeb?&#8221; asked his father, as Zeb
came sleepily poking down the stairs. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
you went to bed early enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;The longer I sleep
the better I seem to know how. If I keep on
learning, I may be able to sleep a week, some of
these long nights.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away with the cows, then. You won&#8217;t
get any breakfast, now, till you come back.
Hullo, there&#8217;s Dr. Dryer at the gate. What&#8217;s
up now?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Quite enough, one would think, and it was a
very natural instinct which led the doctor to
that particular house with his story.</p>

<p>Not a hoof had his red-headed errand-boy
found in his lot back of his barn, that morning.
Gate wide open. Cows gone, nobody knew
whither.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something sure to happen in this place every
time I oversleep myself,&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;Do
you think they&#8217;re stolen, Doctor, or did that little
scamp of yours leave your gate open and let &#8217;em
run away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Run away? Hope that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said the
deacon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you looked for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everywhere,&#8221; replied the doctor, who had
been narrowly eying Zebedee.</p>

<p>The latter did not flinch a hair&#8217;s breadth, however,
although he now seemed wide awake
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said he, suddenly, &#8220;I see what the
doctor&#8217;s after. I&#8217;ll just put our cows in the
pasture&mdash;not half an hour&#8217;s work. Then you
have the bay saddled, and I&#8217;ll ride off after his
critters. Get a lot of the boys to help me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
We&#8217;ll find &#8217;em for you, Doctor. You threatened
to drown me, day before yesterday, and I&#8217;m glad
to have a chance of returning good for evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was off like a shot, and even his grim-visaged
father more than half smiled, as he remarked:
&#8220;Best you can do, Doctor. I&#8217;ll have
the bay colt ready for him when he gets back.
Not another boy in the whole valley&#8217;d be so sure
to make a find of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Dryer looked more solemn than ever, and
shook his head ominously, for the thought which
had brought him to Deacon Fuller&#8217;s had hardly
been permitted a fair expression.</p>

<p>Halfway down the path to the barn, Zeb was
met by still another interested party, who rose
lazily from the ground at his approach, cocked
one dilapidated ear at him, and mutely inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and what&#8217;s to be done now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Bob,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;but it&#8217;s too soon
to wag your tail yet. We must take all day to
it. If we should find &#8217;em right off, it&#8217;d look bad.
We&#8217;ll tend our own cows first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob stopped the tail-wagging, though there
could have been very little effort required to wag
such a stump as that, and trotted off after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
master with a thoroughly canine faith that there
was fun to come of some kind.</p>

<p>A large, mastiff-built brindled dog was Bob,
for whom all the other village dogs had an unbounded
respect, if not esteem. He was one of
those dogs that no sane human being ever tries
to steal.</p>

<p>Zeb&#8217;s usual morning &#8220;chores&#8221; were finished
up in rapid style, even for him, and by that time,
too, he had succeeded in getting messages to half
a dozen of his most trusted friends.</p>

<p>It looked very much, even to the watching
eyes of Dr. Dryer, as if the &#8220;hunt&#8221; were to be
made in earnest, and Effie stood behind him and
Mrs. Dryer at the window, thinking what a
grand time of it the boys would have, and half
wishing she could join them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the least he can do,&#8221; remarked Mrs.
Dryer. &#8220;I do hope nothing has happened to
that dun heifer. Those cows never ran away of
their own accord.&#8221;</p>

<p>If they had only been near enough to Deacon
Fuller&#8217;s front gate a few minutes later, they
could have heard as well as seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, boys,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;you&#8217;re all to hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for &#8217;em, but I&#8217;m going on horseback, and of
course I&#8217;ll find &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might, some of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you mightn&#8217;t,&#8221; responded Zeb. &#8220;Bill
Jones, you and Hy Allen scout out towards the
lake. Take your hooks and lines in your pockets
and be gone all day. If you catch any fish,
you can give &#8217;em away to somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if we don&#8217;t get back till after dark,&#8221; said
Hy Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;Now, the rest of you
might try the East hill. I&#8217;m going on the North
road, over into Rodney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might go for woodchucks,&#8221; suggested
one of the smaller boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might,&#8221; said another, &#8220;but then the old
sweet tree in the Parker&#8217;s orchard&#8217;s about ripe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Bill Jones, &#8220;and I saw him
going through the village this very morning.
Both his dogs with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Zeb. &#8220;Bob and I and the
bay colt don&#8217;t mean to come back till we bring
Sol Dryer&#8217;s cows along with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for Zeb Fuller!&#8221; shouted Hy Allen,
and, with a yell of general approbation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
acquiescence in the plans of their chief, for such
he seemed to be, that squad of &#8220;the worst boys
in Ogleport,&#8221; as Dr. Dryer would have called
them, separated, each to his own especial usefulness.</p>

<p>In five minutes more, Zeb was in the saddle,
and he and Bob were off to seek their fortune.</p>

<p>Just a little after noon of that eventful day it
might fairly have been said that the plans of Zeb
Fuller had fairly begun to ripen.</p>

<p>Bill Jones and Hy Allen were busily at work
under a tree by the lake shore, building a fire to
aid them in the preparation of their lunch. The
borrowed boat they had pulled up on the beach
had a very fine show of fish in it, but not a sign
of a cow, and the pair of them seemed just as
well contented.</p>

<p>Miles away, on the eastern hillside, another
detachment of Zeb&#8217;s faithful army were admiring
the furry coats of no less than three woodchucks
which they and their attendant curs had dug out
and captured, while not a boy among them all
could have got his hands into his pockets or put
his hat on his head until he should have eaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
more half-ripe sweet apples than any one boy
could have the slightest hope of holding.</p>

<p>Long miles away, again to the northward, the
bay colt, without one flake of perspiration upon
his glossy sides to indicate that he had been
driven around the country very extensively, was
pulled up in the middle of an open, unfenced bit
of woodland, while his rider sat looking wistfully
in all directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a hoof or a horn!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;I&#8217;d
no notion they&#8217;d wander out of this. Gone on
North, anyhow. Come, Bob, we&#8217;ll come up with
&#8217;em before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not quite so soon as he thought, however, for
one mile, two miles, and then a third, vanished
under the now quickened pace of the bay colt,
and the merry face of his rider was growing
longer and longer, before a bark from Bob and a
shout from his master greeted the discovery of
cattle ahead.</p>

<p>And there they were, surely enough, the dun
heifer and the two older cows, but not by any
means feeding leisurely at the wayside, as they
should have been.</p>

<p>On the contrary, they were being driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
steadily along northward, in the charge of three
ragged, disreputable-looking, vagabond boys, two
of them of about Zeb&#8217;s size and one younger, and a
big, mangy-looking yellow dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; shouted Zeb, as he galloped up and
passed them, reining in the bay colt across the
road. &#8220;What are you doing with them
cows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drivin&#8217; &#8217;em to the paound,&#8221; exclaimed one of
the larger boys, with a malicious grin. &#8220;That&#8217;s
wot we dew with stray critters over here in
Rodney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over here in Rodney!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb.
&#8220;Why, those cows belong to Ogleport. Stolen
last night out of the Rev. Dr. Solomon Dryer&#8217;s
own yard. I&#8217;ll have you all arrested and sent to
jail. Pound! I&#8217;ll pound ye. Give &#8217;em up, right
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little spasm of uncertainty on the
faces of the vagabonds, but the &#8220;pound reward&#8221;
for stray cattle in Rodney was a dollar a head,
and they could not bear the thought of surrendering
wealth like that to a boy of Zeb&#8217;s size
from a rival township.</p>

<p>They said as much in a moment more, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
in such a dogged and threatening manner, and
with such a profusion of unsavory epithets, that
Zeb Fuller&#8217;s valor got the better of his discretion.</p>

<p>He was no cavalryman.</p>

<p>All his fighting had hitherto been done on
foot.</p>

<p>So he wisely cantered a few rods up the road,
sprang from the saddle, hitched the bay, shouted
to Bob, and started back for the duty that so
plainly lay before him, cudgel in hand.</p>

<p>It was one against three, to be sure, for Bob
recognized at once his mission to that yellow dog,
but Zeb had special reasons of his own for not
flinching.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was even less a sense of duty to the
Rev. Dr. Solomon Dryer than of unexpressed
remorse.</p>

<p>If those three vagabonds looked for an easy
victory, however, they were sorely mistaken.</p>

<p>The dun heifer had been &#8220;hard to drive&#8221; all
along, and she headed her mates in a vigorous
break backward at the first rush of Zeb and his
faithful ally.</p>

<p>It was all in vain that the smaller of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
&#8220;impounders&#8221; rushed so wildly after them, and
that lessened the odds against Zeb.</p>

<p>They were hard fighters, though, those two
vagabonds of Rodney, and Deacon Fuller&#8217;s hopeful
heir had all his work cut out for him.</p>

<p>He was no scientific boxer, nor was either of
his opponents, but Bob was more of an expert,
and by the time Zeb began to really find himself
in difficulty so did that unlucky yellow dog.</p>

<p>The worst of it was, however, that Bob deemed
it his duty to make a clean finish of his particular
job instead of coming to the help of his master.</p>

<p>Alas, for Zeb!</p>

<p>His cudgel was wrenched from his panting
grasp, at last, though not till he had used it to
excellent effect, and while he grappled with one
of his foes the other was free to belabor him to
his heart&#8217;s content. The result might have been
bad for Dr. Dryer&#8217;s cows, but, just then, there
came a sound of heavy wheels on the road above,
and over the nearest &#8220;rise&#8221; of ground the daily
stage-coach that plied up and down the valley
came lumbering down to the field of battle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Zeb&#8217;s Fight with the Rodney Boys</span></p>

<p>So intent were the combatants, however, that
the driver was compelled to pull in his horses to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
keep from going over them in spite of his angrily
shouted warnings.</p>

<p>For a wonder, the stage contained but three
passengers, two old ladies and a fine-looking, tall,
athletic young man.</p>

<p>The latter, however, had his head out of the
window instantly, with:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, driver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys fightin&#8217; in the road, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fighting? I declare!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the stranger was out on level ground immediately.</p>

<p>Even the vagabonds loosened their hold in
consideration of the new arrival, and his sternly
uttered reproofs and expostulations were replied
to with a sullen:</p>

<p>&#8220;None of yer bisness. He&#8217;s a-takin&#8217; away
aour paound caows, an&#8217; we&#8217;re a-lickin&#8217; of him,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, they ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Zeb, sturdily.
&#8220;Bob, come here. There now, I&#8217;m ready
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready for what, my young friend?&#8221; asked
the stranger, for he could not but see the difference
between Zeb and the other two, for all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
bloody nose and disordered apparel. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean to fight any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I?&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;I mean to drive
home Dr. Dryer&#8217;s cows if I fight all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Dryer&#8217;s cows? Dr. Dryer, of the Ogleport
Academy?&#8221; asked the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Solomon,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;That&#8217;s the man.
Those are his cows down the road there. Got
away last night. I came after &#8217;em and found
these Rodney rascals driving &#8217;em to the pound.
Of course they can&#8217;t have &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221; exclaimed the stranger.
&#8220;You&#8217;re perfectly right, my young friend. If
that&#8217;s your horse yonder, just mount him and
we&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;ll be any more trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three vagabonds, for the smaller one had
now come running up, took a good look at the
stranger, another at the pugnacious attitude of
Zeb, another at Bob, who was evidently getting
dangerously impatient.</p>

<p>They looked with one accord at what was left
of their big, yellow dog, now limping and yelping
up the road, and then, with many a threat and
whine and morsel of smothered abuse, they slowly
sneaked away after their dog.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Zeb was on the bay colt&#8217;s back quickly enough,
and the dun heifer and her friends moved cheerfully
on before him in the direction of Ogleport.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Bar Vernon&#8217;s companion in the carriage
during his ride up-town that morning had been
Judge Danvers, instead of Dr. Manning, he
would doubtless have been subjected to a sort of
conversational &#8220;cross-examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, he had half expected something of the
sort, but the worthy doctor having fairly got
rid of his pecuniary load and the troubles connected
with it, had mentally gone back to his
patients and was not a whit more talkative than
his inborn politeness demanded of him.</p>

<p>Indeed, on arriving at the house, the doctor
only waited to introduce Bar to Mrs. Manning,
after a very brief talk with that lady in an inner
room, and tell her to &#8220;send for Val,&#8221; and then
he was off to the reception of his long-delayed
&#8220;callers&#8221; and the performance of his daily
routine of healing duty.</p>

<p>Bar&#8217;s previous experiences had led him into all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sorts of places, good and bad, but never before
had he seen the interior of a home like that, so
full of all the appliances which modern invention
and the refinements of human art have provided
for wealth and culture.</p>

<p>It was a sort of new world to him, and
he found its unaccustomed atmosphere more
than a little oppressive at first.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Manning, with her gentle face, her
beautiful gray hair and her kindly, easy, perfectly
well-bred manners, seemed to him so like
a being from another sphere, that her presence
made him uneasy.</p>

<p>She understood him better than he imagined,
however, and although she had plenty of questions
in her mind, she considerately postponed
them for a more convenient season.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very wonderful,&#8221; thought Bar. &#8220;To
think of that pocketbook business bringing about
all this! But I wonder who Val is?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some little time before his curiosity was
gratified, and then Mrs. Manning left him alone
in the library, for a few minutes, to wonder
at the multitude of elegant books, the folios
of maps and engravings, and the rarely beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
pictures. When she returned she was accompanied
by a young gentleman of about Bar&#8217;s age,
though scarcely so strongly built, whom she introduced
as:</p>

<p>&#8220;My son Valentine, Mr. Vernon. I shall
have to put you in his care for the rest of the
day. I hope, and so does Dr. Manning, that you
will be very good friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Valentine Manning was not only lighter built
than Barnaby Vernon, he was a good deal
lighter in the color of his hair, and the complexion
of his face. His eyes were gray instead
of the brownish-black of Bar&#8217;s, and he was
in every respect a good deal more of a &#8220;boy,&#8221; at
least to all outward appearances. He had never
had the severe experiences which had so steadied
and sobered his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>There was little danger that Bar would long
feel as much shyness in his presence as in that of
his mother, though he was a little awkward
at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother says you&#8217;re to visit with me,&#8221; said
the doctor&#8217;s son, after they found themselves
alone, &#8220;and that then you&#8217;re going out to Ogleport
to school.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bar, reservedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever been at the Academy before?&#8221; asked
his new friend. &#8220;I never heard of you. What&#8217;s
your first name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnaby. Bar Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar? That&#8217;s a good handle. Mine&#8217;s Val.
You can&#8217;t expect a fellow to be saying mister all
the time. Did you say you&#8217;d been to Ogleport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bar, with an effort. &#8220;I was never
at school in all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled Val. &#8220;What an ignoramus
you must be! Did you ever study algebra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor geometry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw the word in a newspaper, once,&#8221; said
Bar, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then won&#8217;t you have a high old time with
Dr. Dryer, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; exclaimed Val. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Bar, eager to come up in something;
&#8220;I can read and write, and all that. Let
me show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar took up a pen, but, before he had written
a half dozen lines, Val stopped him with:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&#8220;There, now, that&#8217;ll do. You can beat me all
hollow with a pen. Pity you don&#8217;t know
French, or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; exclaimed Bar, &#8220;I can talk French, and
German, too, and a little Spanish. It&#8217;s easy
enough to pick up such things. What I don&#8217;t
know is what you learn at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Val, &#8220;I wish I could pick up
as much as that. Anyhow, I s&#8217;pose there&#8217;s lots
of things I can teach you. Did you ever go
fishing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never had a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor hunting, nor skating?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but I can shoot. I had
to learn that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know where you&#8217;ve lived all your
life,&#8221; remarked Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll tell you some day,&#8221; said Bar,
seriously, &#8220;but I&#8217;d rather not just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val Manning was a gentleman, boy as he
was; and he colored to his ears as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now, beg your pardon. Mother told
me I mustn&#8217;t ask you any questions. Come on
into the billiard-room and I&#8217;ll teach you how to
play. Father never wants me to go to a public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
billiard-hall, you know, so he has a tip-top table
here at home. Plays himself sometimes, when
the sick people give him a chance. Come
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar followed his young host into the neat and
cozy apartment in the third story to which
he led the way, and he felt a species of awe come
over him as he passed one evidence after another
of what plenty of money can do for the home of
such a man as Dr. Manning.</p>

<p>Val picked up a cue and Bar listened in silence
to the very clear and practical sort of lecture
that followed on the rudiments of the game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose we play one now,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;and
you can tell me more as we go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val assented, with hearty good-will, and he
really showed a good deal of dexterity, for a boy
of his age, in the noble art of knocking the ivory
balls about.</p>

<p>He made a very good &#8220;run&#8221; before he missed,
and then drew back with:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, Barnaby, the balls are in an awful bad
position. I couldn&#8217;t make that carrom myself.
Not many men could, but you&#8217;ll never learn if
you don&#8217;t try. This is the shot. See?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Bar had been leisurely chalking his cue. Some
things Val had said had unintentionally nettled
him, and he had hardly been as frank as he should
have been.</p>

<p>Now, however, he stepped quietly forward,
made the impossible shot with an ease and quickness
which altogether electrified Val, and followed
it up with a dozen others of almost equal difficulty,
ending by running the two red balls into a corner
and scoring a clean fifty before he made a
miss-cue and lost control of them.</p>

<p>Val had stood watching him in silence to the
end, but when Bar turned to him with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your turn again now!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My turn? I should say so. Well, I&#8217;ll play
the game out, but billiards isn&#8217;t one of the things
that I have to teach you. You can give me lessons
all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it looked, indeed, but poor Bar had paid
dearly enough for that useless bit of an accomplishment,
and he would gladly have traded
it with Val for a few of the things the latter probably
valued very lightly.</p>

<p>After the billiards, Val suggested a visit to the
gymnasium, not a great many blocks away, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
there he was even more astonished than he had
been in the billiard-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you only knew a little algebra and geometry!&#8221;
he exclaimed, enthusiastically, &#8220;you&#8217;d be a
treasure to the Academy. Won&#8217;t we have fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Val.
&#8220;Wait till we get there, though. I just want
some of those country fellows to try on their
games again. I was almost alone last term, and
they were too much for me. Got awfully thrashed
twice, and I&#8217;m just dying to try &#8217;em on again.
Been training for it all vacation. But you&#8217;re
worth three of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll back you,&#8221; shouted Bar. &#8220;But then,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I thought we were going to the Academy
to study?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we are,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;and I wouldn&#8217;t disappoint
my mother for anything, nor my father,
either, but you can&#8217;t study all the while, and
there&#8217;s any quantity of fun in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were coming down the stairs from the
gymnasium into the street, while they were talking,
and just then, as they reached the sidewalk,
Bar grasped his friend&#8217;s arm with:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>&#8220;Val&mdash;Val&mdash;let&#8217;s hurry. There&#8217;s a man I
don&#8217;t want to have see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val moved quickly enough, but he should not
have looked at the same time, for he thereby attracted
the attention of a large, showily-dressed
man, seemingly some sort of a gentleman whose
eyes they might otherwise have avoided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! my young fellow! Have I found you?
What have you done with my valise? Come
right along with me, now. I&#8217;ve been hunting
you for a week. Come along, Mr. Jack Chills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar&#8217;s cheeks had turned a trifle pale at first,
but they were blazing red now. It seemed to
him as if all his &#8220;new time&#8221; were suddenly in
peril, and he determined not to lose it without
an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken in the man,&#8221; he firmly
replied. &#8220;My name is not Chills, but Vernon&mdash;Barnaby
Vernon. If you annoy me I shall call
the police at once. Take away your hand,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Police, indeed? Do you mean to say I&#8217;m
not your guardian, Major Montague? And do
you mean to say you&#8217;re not my nephew, and that
you did not run away with my valise and all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
valuable papers? Come right along. I shan&#8217;t
give you up, now I&#8217;ve got you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Police!&#8221; shouted Bar, stoutly, and:</p>

<p>&#8220;Police! police!&#8221; echoed Val, with a boyish
resolve to stand by his friend.</p>

<p>It was not a quarter of the city in which the
police are most plentiful, or it may be Major
Montague would have hesitated, anxious as he
was, for reasons of his own, to amend the errors
of his fit of maudlin penitence, but, just
for that once, the shout of the two boys fell
on the right pair of ears, and the Major was
actually brought face to face with a &#8220;very intelligent-looking
cop,&#8221; as Val afterwards described
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; was his first and somewhat
rough question, addressed to the two
boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I?&#8221; exclaimed Val, proudly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
Valentine Manning, son of Dr. Randall Manning,
and this is Mr. Barnaby Vernon, who is visiting
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; added Bar, pointing at Major
Montague, &#8220;is a very well-known bad character.
I believe he is a professional pickpocket; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
couldn&#8217;t make a charge against him, except for
assault on me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d better take you in charge,&#8221;
began the policeman; but just then the proprietor
of the gymnasium came down the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything the matter, Mr. Manning?&#8221; he said
to Val. &#8220;I thought you and your friend were
up in the room. Policeman, what is that fellow
up to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some game or other, I don&#8217;t quite understand
what. My man,&#8221; he added to the Major, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
missed it this time. I&#8217;ll remember you, though.
Move on, now, and don&#8217;t let me see you loafing
on my beat. Move!&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Montague&#8217;s face was purple with wrath,
but he saw very clearly that it was not his day.
How on earth Bar should so soon have found
friends, and strange ones, and become a recognized
member of &#8220;society,&#8221; instead of a homeless
and wandering vagabond, was a puzzle that surpassed
his utmost guessing.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it, however, for there
stood the gymnasium proprietor, one of the best
known men in the city, and there was the policeman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>Dreadfully positive and practical looked the
latter, to be sure; and the Major had no choice
but to give the matter up for a bad job and
&#8220;move on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He determined, however, to get at the bottom
of the mystery some day, cost what it might.</p>

<p>Bar thanked the policeman very pleasantly, as
he and Val turned away, but he felt as if there
would be a load of fear on his heart until he could
get off somewhere, away beyond the danger of
any more such meetings.</p>

<p>Not but that he felt sure of protection from
any real harm, but he wanted his deliverance
from his &#8220;old time&#8221; to be absolute and complete,
and it could hardly be so with Major Montague
in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to ask any questions, Bar,&#8221;
said Val, &#8220;but does my father know anything
about that fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a right to ask that,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Yes,
he does, and so does Judge Danvers. I meant
every word I said to him or about him. He&#8217;s a
miserable fellow, and I don&#8217;t mean he shall
bother me at all. Let&#8217;s go somewhere and get a
lunch. I&#8217;ll stand treat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Val. &#8220;You&#8217;re my
guest, you know. Come on. I know where we
can get a tip-top one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he did, for he took Bar at once to a
fashionable up-town restaurant of the very first
class.</p>

<p>The way to it was in the opposite direction
from the one Major Montague had taken, and
Bar experienced a feeling of relief at finding
himself at one of the little marble-topped tables,
with so many well-appearing ladies and gentlemen
around him. A moment later, however, Val
asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Bar, my boy? You look
pale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; replied Bar; &#8220;only do you see
that tall, French-looking party, three tables
away down the aisle, there on the right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see him,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;You can never tell
anything by the looks of those foreigners. I
took one for a gambler a while ago, and he
turned out to be a Count somebody. Maybe
that&#8217;s a Count. Do you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see if he stays to finish his dinner,&#8221;
said Bar. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to speak to me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>The stranger, if his exterior had been rerranged
to suit, might have resembled a gentleman
by the name of Prosper, but, just then and
there, he was managing a very different character,
for his former plans, as we have seen, had
been badly broken up, and he was for the present,
not only alone in the world, but anxious to
remain so.</p>

<p>His position was &#8220;sidewise&#8221; to that of the
two friends, and there was no one between
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to him as if a voice close
to his ear exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia leather, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>He cast a quick and startled glance around
him, but failed to discover the source of the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bad fit,&#8221; said the voice again, but this
time the stranger merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing else in it,&#8221; was the next remark of
his mysterious neighbor. A moment more and
he heard:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he made nothing by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the doctor got it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do such fellows come here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>One after another the words, in varying tones
and seemingly close beside him, added their harrowing
suggestions, and the cold sweat was beginning
to stand out on the forehead of the
unfortunate &#8220;foreigner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would not have looked around him for the
world, but he stealthily reached out to the hat-rack
for his hat and cane, and was swiftly gliding
out of the front door, when a watchful waiter
intercepted him with the polite suggestion that
he had better pay for his dinner first.</p>

<p>He was glad enough to do that, nor did he
once look back from the &#8220;pay-desk.&#8221; It was
not likely he would soon again venture into that
precise restaurant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar, my boy,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;who was it talking
with that chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything more, sir?&#8221; suddenly inquired the
voice of the waiter, who had attended them, just
behind Val&#8217;s chair. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t make a pig
of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val wheeled angrily, to find that not a soul
was standing near him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar!&#8221; he exclaimed, turning back, &#8220;did you
hear that? Did he mean me?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, hush, and take a pill.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the waiter&#8217;s voice again, closer than before,
and Val sprang to his feet indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t step on me! Here I am, down here.
Take your foot off. Oh, what a mouth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Val had lifted his feet quickly enough, but
involuntarily, but now he gazed earnestly in the
motionless face of his new friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar Vernon, are you a ventriloquist!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he is,&#8221; exclaimed the voice on the
floor. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see how long his ears are?
Take your foot off. There, now I can die in
peace. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>A long, choking sort of gurgle followed, but
Val&#8217;s face was all one radiance of triumphant
fun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar, is that so? Hurrah for that! Won&#8217;t
we have larks up in Ogleport, and everywhere
else? Let&#8217;s go home now. You&#8217;re just the
sort of chum I&#8217;d have asked for. Why, we&#8217;ll
have some fun at the house this very evening.
Come on.&#8221;</p>

<small>ZEB&#8217;S FAME PRECEDES HIM</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stage-driver was getting somewhat impatient,
although the delay had not been a long
one, but the stranger turned for one more word
with Zeb Fuller before he climbed back to his
seat in front of the two old ladies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a son of Dr. Dryer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Son?&#8221; exclaimed Zeb, as he held in the bay
colt. &#8220;Oh, no. Solomon&#8217;s a good boy, and I&#8217;ve
done what I could to bring him up right, but
he&#8217;s no son of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring him up!&#8221; exclaimed the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had him under my care
for several years now, at the Academy, but
there&#8217;s some things he won&#8217;t learn. The boys
get away from him, and so do the cows. I wish
I had some one to help me with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A ringing laugh responded to Zeb&#8217;s last remark,
and:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll try, then. I&#8217;m Mr. George Brayton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and I&#8217;m on my way to join Dr. Dryer. I&#8217;ll
tell him how hard a fight you had for his cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb&#8217;s face lengthened a little, but he answered,
quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget Bob. Solomon doesn&#8217;t understand
dogs much better than he does boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely as not,&#8221; exclaimed Brayton to himself,
as he sprang into the stage. &#8220;Go on, driver.
Now, there&#8217;s a boy worth somebody&#8217;s while to
understand. Hullo! you didn&#8217;t tell me your
name, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as the stage rolled on, Brayton heard
something that sounded very much like:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rev. Zebedee Fuller, D. D., LL. D., etc.,&#8221;
for Zeb remained behind at his duty.</p>

<p>The latter had no more difficulty in it. The
cows had been milked, all three of them, and
Zeb was glad of it, but they were in a worried
and disconsolate frame of mind, and glad enough
to find their peaceful heads turned homeward.</p>

<p>Bob had suffered very little in his combat with
the yellow dog, and was now evidently conscious
that he and his master had gained a very substantial
kind of victory. You could see the
sense of triumph expressing itself in the rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
erectness of his remaining ear, and in the unyielding
pride of his stump of a tail. A very
intelligent sort of dog was Bob.</p>

<p>As for Zeb, that young gentleman had hardly
come off so well as his canine ally, for the vagabonds
had been hard hitters, and every bone of
his body bore witness to that fact.</p>

<p>His face, too, was even less of a beauty than
usual, and the cast in his left eye was by no
means robbed of its effect by the deep tinge of
blue which was beginning to show under the
right.</p>

<p>Zeb had chaffed bravely enough with Mr.
Brayton, but his mind was by no means easy,
after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put my foot in it, as usual,&#8221; he said aloud to
himself; &#8220;but how was I to guess that he was
old Sol&#8217;s new man? Seems a good one, too.
Not exactly the sort they generally make teachers
of. Most generally they make &#8217;em out of the
chips after they&#8217;ve used up all the good timber
on men. Now, he looks like a man. Well, if he
is, he won&#8217;t tell on me in any bad way. Why,
there was a speck of fight in his eyes, too, and I
know he&#8217;d ha&#8217; liked to see Bob walk into that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
yellow dog. Reckon that might have done even
old Sol some good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb was in no way impatient to reach the end
of his journey. In fact, the nearer he came to
Ogleport the better contented he seemed to be
that the cattle should take his own gait.</p>

<p>Still, those few miles could not last forever,
and before sunset Zeb found himself in such a
position as he had never occupied before. He
was still on the back of the bay colt, and Dr.
Dryer&#8217;s cows were plodding along before him
down the main street of the village, but it
seemed as if he had never before realized how
many boys Ogleport contained.</p>

<p>They were all there, and determined to emphasize
their appreciation of their hero by a species
of triumphal procession.</p>

<p>The news of Zeb&#8217;s exploit had preceded him,
growing as it traveled, and the smaller the size
of the Ogleport boy might be, the more vividly
his imagination had supplied him with crowds of
the ferocious vagabonds of Rodney, on horseback
and on foot, and miscellaneously armed and
arrayed, with Zebedee Fuller careering among
them on his father&#8217;s bay colt, and valorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
rescuing from their rapacious grasp the erring
kine of the Rev. Dr. Dryer.</p>

<p>It had seemed at first like an impossible romance,
a vision of the Middle Ages, or a leaf
torn from a dime novel, but behold the reality
was here, and no boy could disbelieve his own
eyes.</p>

<p>There were the cows, safe and sound. There
was the bay colt, and on his back rode home in
glory the hero of the hand-to-hand conflict, his
face yet liberally smeared with unwiped gore
from his nose, now badly puffed, while every
square inch of his summer clothing bore tokens
that he had measured his length in the dust and
mud of Rodney.</p>

<p>It was a grand thing for the boys of Ogleport.
Every soul of them rose from one to five pegs in
his own estimation, and took on more exalted
views of the course in life which he must necessarily
pursue that he might equal, some coming
day, the laurels of the victorious Zeb.</p>

<p>Not the least appreciative of all these worshipers
was the level-headed youth who delivered to
Bob a bone of unusual size and meatiness.</p>

<p>That was the way Zeb came to miss his faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
follower, for Bob was a conscientious dog, and
that bone had to be entombed at once in the deacon&#8217;s
backyard.</p>

<p>Zeb&#8217;s spirits were rising rapidly, but, just before
he reached the wide open gate of Dr. Dryer&#8217;s
cow-lot, the voice of his father smote upon his ear
with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee, my son, have you been fighting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly, father,&#8221; replied Zeb; &#8220;the other
fellows did the fighting. Bob and I went for the
cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will your mother say?&#8221; exclaimed the
deacon, for it really required an unusual amount
of hypocrisy to be hard on Zeb just then, and the
deacon was no hypocrite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! Why, father, you don&#8217;t suppose she&#8217;ll
take the side of those Rodney boys, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever answer the deacon might have made
was interrupted by the appearance of the Rev.
Dr. Dryer, attended by the females of his
family and by Mr. George Brayton himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the boy, Doctor,&#8221; said the latter.
&#8220;You&#8217;d have had to get your cows out of the
Rodney pound if it hadn&#8217;t been for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wish some person would afford me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
trustworthy information as to the manner of their
escape from my own inclosure,&#8221; replied the doctor,
solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you fastened the gate last
night?&#8221; asked Zeb.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am positive that all things were in order
when I retired,&#8221; was the response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s only one way they could have
got out,&#8221; said Zeb.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the deacon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flying,&#8221; said Zeb; &#8220;and, not being used to it
they flew further than they meant to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Effie Dryer came to the relief of her puzzled
elders with a burst of girlish merriment, in which
George Brayton, though more reservedly, was
willing enough to join her; but her father&#8217;s
countenance was full of stern reproof of both her
and Zeb.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too much disposed to trifle, my young
friend,&#8221; he said to the latter. &#8220;You have done
me a very excellent service, for which I thank
both you and your worthy father. I regret exceedingly
the apparent necessity of a resort to
violence. You have evidently suffered severe
contusions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>&#8220;But, Doctor!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb, &#8220;you ought to
have seen those two Rodney chaps. My face isn&#8217;t
a sign to their&#8217;n. And then their dog! Bob had
him down for close on to five minutes. You&#8217;d
have enjoyed it as well as I did if you&#8217;d only been
there. Ask Mr. Brayton. He missed the best of
it, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say,&#8221; said the gentleman appealed to,
&#8220;that Zeb had evidently done his whole duty by
his opponents, and his dog had left nothing to
ask for on his part. Zeb, hadn&#8217;t you better go
home and wash your face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Zeb,&#8221; exclaimed his father, &#8220;and tell your
mother about it and take care of the bay colt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb was glad enough to get away, for he was
becoming conscious that Effie Dryer&#8217;s merry eyes
had discovered something absurd and laughable
in his appearance, and he was by no means
&#8220;hardened&#8221; enough to stand that.</p>

<p>He was quite well satisfied, moreover, to avoid
any further discussion of the manner in which
the cows had &#8220;escaped&#8221; the night before, for a
more utterly wingless set of quadrupeds were
never accused of flying.</p>

<p>As for his mother, good soul, Zeb had small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
fears of any trouble there, as soon as she should
be sure that he had suffered no real injury.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Fuller, the meekest soul in Ogleport,
had come of sound &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; stock, and
the deacon himself would have been more surprised
than Zeb was at the real character of the
&#8220;scolding&#8221; she gave him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t help it, Zeb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not without giving up the cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure there was no other way but to fight
those boys? I wouldn&#8217;t have had to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have had to let &#8217;em drive the cows to
the pound, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought you were doing your duty, then,
Zeb?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; said Zeb, firmly. &#8220;It was my
fault that the cows got away, and so it was my
duty to bring &#8217;em back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Zeb! More of your mischief? I&#8217;m sorry
for that, and I&#8217;m sorry you had to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Zeb, my boy, I&#8217;m not at all sorry you
tried to do your duty, and that you didn&#8217;t
flinch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb half believed his mother to be an angel at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
any time, but she had never before seemed nearer
one than just then.</p>

<p>It was pretty certain her words would return
to him some other time, when a question should
arise between duty and &#8220;flinching.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then, however, after a good bit of work at
the wash-basin, Zeb went out to look after the
wants of the bay colt, with a glow at his heart
and a sort of feeling that he wouldn&#8217;t mind having
his other eye blackened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting awful stiff, though,&#8221; he said to
himself, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t believe I could make much
of a wrestle till I get the marks of that club off
my arms and legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>On his way to the pasture afterwards, Zeb
learned from Bill Jones and Hy Allen the results
of their day&#8217;s fishing, and the other boys assured
him they had kept for him a liberal share of the
spoils of the old &#8220;sweet tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Dr. Dryer&#8217;s house, that evening was an
unusually lively one, for the doctor and his wife,
and even Effie herself, were &#8220;on their good behavior&#8221;
in one sense over the newcomer.</p>

<small>THE PUZZLED PROFESSOR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the return of the boys to the house of Dr.
Manning, Val&#8217;s hospitable young mind had
been somewhat disturbed as to how he should
amuse his new friend during the remaining hours
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get father to lend
us the carriage, and we&#8217;ll have a grand drive, and
next day we&#8217;ll do something else. Maybe we&#8217;ll
go fishing. There&#8217;s plenty of fun evenings, but
what&#8217;ll we do now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing I&#8217;d like to do,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never saw so many books and things
in all my life as there are in your library. Do
you suppose your father&#8217;d object to my taking a
closer look at them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The library?&#8221; exclaimed Val. &#8220;Why, that
isn&#8217;t much. Father&#8217;d be glad enough if I&#8217;d put
in more time there than I do. Then he&#8217;s got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
whole lot of things in his laboratory. Fun
there, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I know something
about that. We had to work up a whole
lot of experiments once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; said Val, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I and some other fellows.
Only we just learned enough to play our tricks,
that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more&#8217;n I know, except to spoil my
clothes with acids and things,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;Anyhow,
if you can amuse yourself in the library
I&#8217;m glad of it. Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Bar Vernon that afternoon, as he
wandered vaguely from one treasure of printing
to another, as if he were soaking in learning
from those elegantly bound volumes. The very
leather on their backs had something wise and
instructive in the smell of it.</p>

<p>So it seemed, indeed; nor was Bar&#8217;s notion so
far wrong as it might be thought. A man is
always a good deal influenced by his companions,
especially if he takes a personal interest in
them.</p>

<p>The companionship of books is only less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
powerful than that of human beings, just as
their &#8220;study&#8221; is. As for the reverse of the
proposition, if anybody doubts that human beings&mdash;boys,
especially&mdash;&#8220;make an impression&#8221;
on books, just let him lend them his own
favorite volumes, and he will be speedily convinced.</p>

<p>Dr. Manning was by no means displeased that
evening when he heard from Val a faithful account
of the day&#8217;s doings.</p>

<p>Val had nothing to conceal, and he would
never have dreamed of doing so, if he had, for
he was his father&#8217;s own son in straightforward
simplicity.</p>

<p>The dinner-hour was six o&#8217;clock, and after that
there were visitors, and the doctor&#8217;s back-parlor,
opening into the library, looked remarkably
cheerful.</p>

<p>It was a warm evening, and the whole suite
of rooms was thrown into one by opening the
folding-doors, but the front part was only half-lighted.</p>

<p>Bar felt more than a little shy at first, but a
strong feeling of gratitude was rapidly growing
upon him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>What would he not do to keep such friends as
these?</p>

<p>Very kind they were, too; and so were their
visitors, all except the big, burly, pretentious-seeming
personage, who was planting himself on
the piano-stool in such a lordly way, just as Val
whispered to his father:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t Bar play a trick on Professor
Sturm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trick? No, my son, nothing rude. How
could you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not rude, father, only funny. Bar&#8217;s a ventriloquist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the doctor, &#8220;I see; Bar, you must
be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it happened that &#8220;Professor Sturm&#8221; had
already stirred up Bar&#8217;s sense of &#8220;personal resistance,&#8221;
by his previous superciliousness to
both him and Val, and he was quite ready to act
upon the doctor&#8217;s halfway consent.</p>

<p>The professor had evidently proposed to himself
that he would electrify the little company
by what he would do with that piano, and he
now made a dignified and self-confident dash at
the keyboard, after the usual manner of experts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>This would have been succeeded promptly by
another artistic effort if it had not been followed
instantly by a smothered and mournful howl
from the depths of the piano.</p>

<p>The professor&#8217;s hands, on which more than one
huge ring was glittering, came down with a convulsive
start, and the discord produced was acknowledged
by a repeated and more bitter cry of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vas is dese tings?&#8221; exclaimed the man of
music, springing to his feet. &#8220;Dere is somepody
in de biano!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there is,&#8221; replied a voice from the
heart of the mysterious instrument, while the
amazed doctor and his guests came crowding up
with one accord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor,&#8221; asked Professor Sturm, &#8220;dit you
hear dat biano? I shall blay him some more.
You see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor was a man of pluck, but no
sooner did his fingers again begin to wander
over the chords than a tumult began behind the
rosewood in front of him.</p>

<p>Now it was one cat, then three or four. Then
a distressed dog. And then a human voice appealed
to the professor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>&#8220;Please, don&#8217;t. You hurt us dreadfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;De defil&#8217;s in de biano!&#8221; exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the voice, &#8220;not the devil. Only
a lot of notes broke loose. If you&#8217;d only tie us
up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Die &#8217;em up!&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;Doctor,
dit you hear &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard them,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Did
you have any loose notes with you when you
came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loose note, Doctor! Vat is de loose note?&#8221;
cried Professor Sturm, with a fast-reddening
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;In your pocket. Here we are,&#8221; replied a
curious little voice from the professor&#8217;s own
loose sack-coat. &#8220;We love you very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lofe me! Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! let us out, please. It&#8217;s dark in here.
No air. If you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll tell them all what I&#8217;ve
found.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor professor was evidently becoming
sadly perplexed when kind-hearted Mrs. Manning
decided that the boys had pushed their fun
quite far enough.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>&#8220;Not any more, Barnaby,&#8221; she said, pleasantly.
&#8220;Professor, you mustn&#8217;t be angry with
the boys. But don&#8217;t you think he&#8217;s a very good
ventriloquist for one so young?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! dat&#8217;s it,&#8221; exclaimed the professor, glad
enough of an escape from his difficulties. &#8220;Den
I serve him right if I make him sit down at de
biano. Maybe he make some cat and dog
music, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The burly professor suited the action to the
word, and almost before Bar knew it, he found
himself seated at the piano. He would never
have ventured there of his own accord, but it
occurred to him that the very least he could do
was to amuse his new friends by any little accomplishments
he might happen to possess, and
the piano, therefore, immediately asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you there for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Many a stray hour of Barnaby&#8217;s &#8220;old time&#8221;
had been spent in pounding away at one rickety
piano or other, and he really had some natural
genius for music, so that his reply in the shape
of &#8220;amateur performance&#8221; was by no means discreditable
to him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Manning was looking at her husband in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
a good deal of amazement, when the music was
interrupted again by what Val called &#8220;trouble
in the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time the instrument complained that that
kind of playing made him very sick, and begged
Bar to &#8220;fetch on his orchestra.&#8221;</p>

<p>In response to this, there followed a very fair
medley of imitations of half a dozen different
instruments, winding up with a duet between a
cat and an accordion, gleefully accompanied by
the piano.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;now, if you only
get away, I&#8217;d like to have the professor for a
while. Don&#8217;t you wish you could play as well
as he can?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do,&#8221; remarked Bar, politely, as he
rose from the piano-stool. &#8220;I suppose, Professor,
I ought to beg your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no&mdash;no, my young frent,&#8221; exclaimed
the enthusiastic German. &#8220;You haf de great
genius. Nefer in all de vorlt was dere a biano
filled with cats and togs before. I shall ask you
to come mit me some tay. It is all fery goot
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the lady guests declared, but Mrs. Manning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
determined to have another serious talk with
her husband about the very remarkable companion
he had selected for Valentine&#8217;s next year at
school.</p>

<p>A little later and Judge Danvers himself was
announced.</p>

<p>The doctor and the lawyer had a long conference
of their own in the study, and then Barnaby
was sent for.</p>

<p>The judge had a number of questions to ask,
especially concerning Bar&#8217;s meeting that day
with Major Montague, and at the end of it, as if
entirely satisfied with the young adventurer&#8217;s
account of himself, he remarked to Dr. Manning:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Doctor. He and Val had
better be off as soon as possible. Send them
down to the seashore for a few days, and then
let them start for Ogleport. It won&#8217;t hurt them
to get there a little before school begins. Have
you secured a boarding-place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Old Mrs. Wood
will be glad enough of another boarder in her big
old barn of a house. I only wish she could cram
it full, if they were all of the right sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the judge; &#8220;but, from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
you have told me of Barnaby&#8217;s performance this
evening, I fear there are curious times in store
for Mrs. Wood, if not for all Ogleport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, sir!&#8221; exclaimed Bar, &#8220;I pledge you
my word&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now,&#8221; interrupted the judge; &#8220;don&#8217;t
say that. I&#8217;m a dried-up old lawyer myself, but
I am not so cruel or so foolish as to expect all
the boys to be sixty years old. You won&#8217;t do
anything bad or mean, I feel sure of that, and
you mustn&#8217;t lead Val into scrapes; but if you
did promise not to have any fun you couldn&#8217;t
keep it. I don&#8217;t want you to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Bar&#8217;s two &#8220;guardians&#8221; decided, much
to his delight, that he was to be delivered from
any further risks of meeting his &#8220;uncle&#8221; or old
Prosper.</p>

<small>WILLING HANDS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> unusually fine-looking man was George
Brayton, only his full beard and mustache, and
his length and strength of limb, made him seem
at least three years older than he really was.</p>

<p>Perhaps Effie Dryer would have been less
afraid of him if she had known that he was but
twenty-three, hardly more than four years older
than herself.</p>

<p>It was not so easy as the reverend doctor
could have wished, however, for him to look
dignifiedly down upon a man who overtopped
him by a head and outweighed him by at least
fifty pounds of clear bone and muscle.</p>

<p>An evil-disposed person might have added:</p>

<p>&#8220;And who had forgotten more before he left
college than the Academy principal had ever
known in all his born days.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a thing, however, which Dr. Dryer
could hardly have imagined of any human being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
even while he half-scornfully admitted his new
assistant&#8217;s greater familiarity with the chemical
apparatus and &#8220;all that new-fangled trash.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brayton had given a decidedly vivid account
of Zeb&#8217;s valorous behavior on the road, but he
had failed to repeat that young worthy&#8217;s exact
statement of the relations between himself and
&#8220;old Sol.&#8221;</p>

<p>Effie knew very well that he was keeping
back something, but he was altogether too new
an acquaintance to ask any questions of, and she
was compelled to smother her curiosity in a general
&#8220;wonder&#8221; what it could be that made Mr.
Brayton&#8217;s face look so very much as if he were
trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Dryer, that lady smiled all the
evening on the handsome newcomer, and every
time she smiled it seemed to cost her more of an
effort. In fact, before the evening was over,
George Brayton had one thoroughly rooted
enemy in Ogleport, and, when the doctor and
his wife found themselves once more alone, the
first thing that smote upon his ears was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Board with us? That fellow, with all his
airs and graces? He board in our house? No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
indeed! Let him go to old Mrs. Wood&#8217;s, or to
anybody that&#8217;ll take him. My advice to you is
that you get rid of that kind of an assistant as
soon as ever you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dorothy Jane, my dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me, Mr. Dryer. Haven&#8217;t I
your true interests at heart? Don&#8217;t you s&#8217;pose I
can see what&#8217;s coming? It&#8217;ll be just like a
young minister in a church. Everybody&#8217;ll go
mad about him. All the girls&#8217;ll be setting their
caps for him. All the old women&#8217;ll be inviting
him to tea, so&#8217;s to give their daughters a chance.
The young men&#8217;ll hate him, that&#8217;s a comfort.
Such a fellow won&#8217;t have any control over the
boys, neither. Why, he actually laughed twenty
times this very evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very hearty and wholesome laugh, indeed,
had been that of George Brayton&mdash;not at all the
sort to bring upon him the enmity of the young
men, but they were a part of the community
which Mrs. Dr. Dryer had never very thoroughly
understood, and it might be she was as much
mistaken about them now as she had been in
her younger days, if that sort of woman ever
really has any.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>The next morning dawned peacefully enough
upon the sleepy-looking homes of Ogleport, but
there was a general sense of insecurity pervading
the entire community. Perhaps, if anybody
had succeeded in expressing the common feeling,
it would have been a &#8220;Wonder where Zeb
Fuller won&#8217;t turn up next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Parker came down from the East hill
in the middle of the forenoon, full of a wrathfully
determined investigation of the raid on his
orchard during the day before.</p>

<p>He listened with half incredulous amazement
to the account the miller gave him of Zeb&#8217;s
rescue of Dr. Dryer&#8217;s cows, and thus responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother Todderley, if that&#8217;s true I begin to
have my doubts. I don&#8217;t see how any apple tree
in these parts could well be robbed if Zeb Fuller
wasn&#8217;t there. It doesn&#8217;t seem to stand to reason,
somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Squire Parker,&#8221; replied the miller, &#8220;there&#8217;s
worse boys in these parts than Deacon Fuller&#8217;s
son. He saved my life the other day, and I believe
he&#8217;s got the making of a great man in
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is, now!&#8221; exclaimed Parker, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
to a group of boys gathered at the mill-dam.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what mischief&#8217;s on foot this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t learn by asking,&#8221; said the miller,
but his friend exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;m going to take a look at that
crowd of boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they approached, Zeb arose from the log on
which he had been sitting and greeted them ceremoniously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Todderley. Glad to see
you, Mr. Parker; I was thinking of coming to
see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Zeb; &#8220;I was going to ask if you
had any sweet apples to sell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You young rascal, what do you know about
my apples?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your apples?&#8221; cried Zeb, with a surprised
air. &#8220;Why, has anything happened to them?
That was one thing I meant to speak about if I
came to see you. I noticed the other day that
you are careless about them. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve
left &#8217;em out over night, hanging on the trees.
Have any of &#8217;em run away?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>&#8220;Run away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I was afraid it would be so,&#8221;
moralized Zeb. &#8220;Just like old Sol Dryer&#8217;s cows.
There&#8217;s nothing sure in this world, Mr. Parker.
Nothing but death and taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother Todderley!&#8221; exclaimed the angry
old farmer, &#8220;I believe he knows all about it.
I&#8217;ll go right and see his father, at once. I don&#8217;t
believe a word of that cow business&mdash;not a word
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at his eye, Brother Parker,&#8221; argued the
miller, as he hurried to keep pace with his longer-legged
friend. &#8220;Look at his eye. Didn&#8217;t get
that fighting with your apples. No use, Parker.
Look at his eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eye! Eye!&#8221; exclaimed Parker. &#8220;What do
I care about his eye? What I want to know is,
what went with my apples?&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a question the fat miller could not
undertake to answer, and he had hardly breath
left for any other by the time they reached the
mill.</p>

<p>Before noon half of Ogleport was disputing
with the other half whether Zeb Fuller could
have been in old Parker&#8217;s orchard and up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Rodney at the same time, for there was more
than a little common sympathy with the idea
that no out-and-out mischief was probable in
Zeb&#8217;s absence.</p>

<p>He had indeed been present in the flesh at but
one point at a time, but the general impression
was hardly so far wrong as it might have been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Zeb had remarked to his faithful followers,
&#8220;we did splendidly yesterday, all of us,
but there&#8217;s troublesome times ahead. I understand
that that city fellow&#8217;s coming back to the
Academy next term, and there&#8217;ll be twice as many
boarders as ever before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we fix &#8217;em just as we&#8217;ve always done?&#8221;
asked Hy Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either one of us can lick Val Manning,&#8221; said
Bill Jones.</p>

<p>Several more of the larger boys added their
confident self-assurance that the boys of Ogleport
were likely to be equal to any emergency
which could possibly arise, but Zeb shook his
head wisely as he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well, so long as we only had
old Sol to handle, but this new man&#8217;s a very different
sort of a fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid of him,&#8221; said Hy Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; responded half a dozen voices, but
Zeb Fuller again shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t it, boys; the new man&#8217;s all right,
and we must kind o&#8217; stand by him, but there&#8217;ll
be great times at the Academy this fall and
winter, and we must be ready for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all very mysterious and oracular, nor
could Zeb himself have fully explained his prophetic
meaning, but he related to his friends how
George Brayton had rescued him from the three
vagabonds of Rodney, and not a boy of them
but dimly comprehended the possibility of something
new and stirring, if old Sol was to be renforced
by a man of that sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, boys,&#8221; said Zeb, at last, &#8220;it&#8217;s our
first duty to explore the Academy. Not one of
us has been inside of it for two months.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying a piece of generalship
like that, and the conclave broke up immediately,
only to find its way, in squads of various
sizes, to the long double line of sheds at the back
of the village green.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>Under cover of these, it was easy enough to
reach, unseen, a point directly in the rear of the
barn-like white edifice which the wisdom of successive
generations had consecrated to learning.</p>

<p>But it was not the outside of the Academy
building which Zeb and his friends had come to
explore.</p>

<p>Neither did they perplex themselves by fruitless
attempts at any of the well-locked doors.</p>

<p>A board of proper length was promptly placed
below one of the first-floor windows in the rear,
not more than ten feet from the ground, and Hy
Allen was clinging to the window-sill in a twinkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fastened on the inside,&#8221; he exclaimed, after
a fruitless effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down, then,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;We must try
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so they did, but with a result that was
but faintly expressed by Zeb Fuller&#8217;s final declaration:</p>

<p>&#8220;Something wrong, boys. Old Sol&#8217;s been
plotting against us again. It won&#8217;t do for us to
go around in front. Not in broad daylight.
But we must look out for our rights. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
thing we shall have a rebellion among the teachers
after the school begins.&#8221;</p>

<p>The symptoms threatened something of the
kind, doubtless, but just then one of the smaller
boys, who had been acting as a sort of scout or
sentinel, came up with the intelligence that a
large wagon was being hauled across the green,
towards the Academy, and that it was accompanied
by the principal himself, with two or
three of the trustees and a stranger, on
foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Zeb. &#8220;That&#8217;s the new
apparatus. Boys, we&#8217;re in the right place at the
right time. It would never do to let that stuff
be stowed away without our help. We&#8217;d never
know where half of it went to.&#8221;</p>

<p>No wonder the boys of Ogleport had such
blind faith in Zeb Fuller&#8217;s leadership.</p>

<p>When the wagon was pulled up in front of the
steps leading to the door of the &#8220;lecture room,&#8221;
in the rear &#8220;addition&#8221; to the main building of
the Academy, Dr. Dryer could hardly repress an
exclamation of surprise at the amount and energy
of the &#8220;popular aid&#8221; which awaited the
unloading of that cargo of scientific goods.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>Not that anything very remarkable showed
itself through the numerous pine-boxes, but Mr.
George Brayton, in the simplicity of his heart,
deemed it a most encouraging sign that so many
of his future pupils should take so deep an interest
in such a matter.</p>

<p>At all events, the strong and willing hands of
Zeb Fuller and the rest made the transfer of
those boxes to the lecture-room floor a very
brief and easy piece of work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Brayton,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;you&#8217;ll want
to show what&#8217;s in them. I&#8217;ll go for a hatchet
and chisel, and we&#8217;ll have &#8217;em open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring a saw, too,&#8221; said Brayton, but Dr.
Dryer wagged his reverend head somewhat suspiciously.
Never before had the boys of Ogleport
taken so deep an interest in the affairs
of the village institution.</p>

<p>That was a great day for Zeb and his friends,
nevertheless. They could hardly be persuaded to
go home to dinner.</p>

<p>The worst of it all, if Dr. Dryer had only
known it, was the frequency with which the
keen eyes of his pupils detected him in turning
over to his assistant the various questions propounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
by the excited &#8220;trustees&#8221; as to the use
of this, that, and the other contrivance of glass
or brass.</p>

<small>NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Barnaby Vernon, at the close of his
first day at Dr. Manning&#8217;s, found himself alone
in the really luxurious room assigned him for the
night, it would have been too much to expect
that he should at once go to bed and to sleep.</p>

<p>The events of the day, no less than his unaccustomed
surroundings, combined to stir such a
fever in his young blood as was not likely to
cool down very soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Montague isn&#8217;t the man to give it up
in that way,&#8221; he said to himself, aloud. &#8220;He
always seemed to take special care of that valise.
No doubt he wants it back again. Now, too, he
may get it into his head that there&#8217;s money
to be made, somehow, out of my new friends.
Reckon I can trust Judge Danvers to take care
of that. Anyhow, I&#8217;m so glad to get away.
Hope it isn&#8217;t too much of a change in Val&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
plans. He doesn&#8217;t seem to mind it, I should say.
Must be a good deal of fun in catching fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after a moment&#8217;s silence, he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a room this is! Splendid thing to be
rich and feel that all your money belongs to you.
Not any swindling tricks for me, money or
no money. Besides, the money that comes that
way don&#8217;t stay. Haven&#8217;t I seen the major and
the rest flush of it, a hundred times? Then
it was sure to go and they were hard up again.
They&#8217;ll bring up, one of these days, where the
dogs can&#8217;t get at them. Wonder what that big
book is on the table? Ha&mdash;that&#8217;s a queer Bible.
Saw one before on a steamboat. Saw another
in a hotel. Best hotel I ever stopped at.
Curious sort of book. It&#8217;s what they preach
about. Guess I&#8217;ll look into it one of these days.
Let me see, wasn&#8217;t there something like that
book away back there, years ago? So there
was. Then my father couldn&#8217;t have been of
Major Montague&#8217;s kind. Wonder if my folks
were Bible folks. Dr. Manning&#8217;s are. Is that
what makes &#8217;em rich? There&#8217;s a good many
things I don&#8217;t know, and that&#8217;s one of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>A good many things, indeed, and Bar had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
into the right sort of hands to learn some of
them.</p>

<p>Hours later, when at last sleep came to him, a
dream came with it, and it seemed to him as if
he were a very little boy indeed, and a very
sweet-faced lady, whose way of smiling made
him think of Mrs. Manning, held him on her
knee while a tall, dark, pale-looking gentleman
read to her from just such a big book as that on
the table in his chamber.</p>

<p>Dreams are very curious things, as everybody
knows, only it&#8217;s the fashion to laugh at them,
and so, perhaps, Barnaby ought to have laughed
at his when he awoke.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t, however, do any such thing, but
he would have liked to know somebody well
enough to tell it, and there was no such person,
for him, in the wide world.</p>

<p>Bar was right, however, about Major Montague.</p>

<p>The preparations for the trip of the two boys
to the seashore were such as could easily be made
in half an hour, and they were off together
on the early train, well supplied with all sorts of
fishing-tackle, and brimful of high spirits and expectation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Even Bar, however, had scarcely guessed how
closely his movements had been followed the
day before.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he been gone two hours, and
while the doctor was busy with his morning list
of &#8220;callers,&#8221; among the latter came a gentleman
whom the good physician thought he would
have recognized, from Bar&#8217;s description, even if
he had not introduced himself as Major Montague.</p>

<p>Any one more profusely polite and so tremendously
dignified at the same time, had not
entered that reception-room in many a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a young gentleman, a relative,
I may say a ward, of mine visiting with you,&#8221;
remarked the major, unchilled by the manner of
his reception. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done myself the honor
to call and see you about him. Glad he&#8217;s in
such good hands, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you mean Mr. Vernon?&#8221; bluntly interrupted
the doctor. &#8220;He left the city this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Left the city!&#8221; exclaimed the major. &#8220;May
I a-a-ask where he&#8217;s gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of me, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped the doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
&#8220;If you want to make any inquiries I must refer
you to Mr. Vernon&#8217;s counsel, Judge Danvers.
I&#8217;ve nothing more to say. Excuse me, sir. I
have patients to attend to. My time&#8217;s not my
own. Good-morning. John, show the gentleman
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>John was just the very man for that kind
of duty, and Major Montague went down the
front steps with the abiding assurance that
he had never been turned out of any other house
so politely and ceremoniously in all his life. He
ought to have been a good judge of that sort of
thing too.</p>

<p>Meantime, Bar and Val found themselves
dashing away across country at the best speed of
the Eastern express train, and they would have
been more or less than boys if they had not set
themselves at once to work on a general investigation
of the character of their fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>Val might scarcely have been accurate or thorough,
but there was something closely approaching
professional skill in Bar&#8217;s observations.</p>

<p>A little in front of them, across the passage, a
double seat had been taken possession of, for the
car was not crowded, by a somewhat feeble-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
but very nice, middle-aged lady and one
of the brightest, prettiest girls, of fifteen years
or thereabouts, that either of the boys had ever
seen.</p>

<p>That was all as it should be, but at the very
first stopping-place, the car was entered by
a flashily-dressed young man, of middle height,
who took a brief survey of the passengers, from
the door, and then walked deliberately forward
and set himself down in the vacant seat by the
side of the lady.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the established usages of
railway traveling which should have made a
positive crime of this, but there was something
in the way the newcomer gazed at the fresh-faced
girl opposite him which brought the blood
to the face of Val Manning.</p>

<p>&#8220;The impudent scamp!&#8221; he muttered to Bar.
&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t he have found another seat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still a bit,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I know what
he&#8217;s up to, or I&#8217;m greatly mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the ladies themselves were disturbed by the
presence of the stranger, they were not disposed
to make any public exhibition of their disgust.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>It is true that the elder seemed to become
more interested than before in the scenery
through which the train was passing, and the
younger took a sudden plunge into a book which
had been lying neglected on her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what he wants,&#8221; said Bar to Val.
&#8220;Anything to keep their eyes off him. There,
that&#8217;s it. He&#8217;s a good deal clumsier than old
Prosper.&#8221;</p>

<p>It happened that, a few seats further on, a
party of four gentlemen were sitting together in
animated conversation, and the outer one of the
two who were facing Bar and Val was a man of
unusual size, though not of a particularly intellectual
appearance.</p>

<p>He had not been paying any attention, that
Val had noticed, to the operations of the flashy
stranger, but now he suddenly exclaimed, or so
it seemed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your hand out of her pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same moment he sprang to his feet as
if in great astonishment, and so did the unwelcome
companion of the two ladies.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221; shouted the latter,
with a face that was white and red by turns, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
then he added, or seemed to add, &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick all
the pockets in this car if I choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will, will you?&#8221; exclaimed the big man,
in a voice whose lion-like depth of &#8220;roar&#8221; contrasted
strangely with the tones of his previous
remark. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say you had picked any
pockets, but I don&#8217;t mean you shall, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; began the flashy man, but
his next words were, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve dropped hers on
the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he put on such a look of abject terror
as no human face can possibly counterfeit,
and sprang away from his place, crying out:</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be the devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; responded the big man, as he
started in pursuit, but there were other hands
extended, and the frightened runaway was
brought to an immediate stand.</p>

<p>Meantime, the ladies, scarcely less astonished
than the pickpocket, had been making a hurried
search.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have indeed lost my pocketbook, Sibyl,&#8221;
said the elder.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there it is, mother, on the floor, just
where he said he had dropped it,&#8221; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Sibyl, but at that very moment Bar Vernon was
picking it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Sibyl, as she took it in
her hand, but Bar replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better open it at once and see if
anything is missing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; asked Sibyl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! miss,&#8221; exclaimed Val, &#8220;do just as he
says. It was his work detecting that man. He&#8217;s
a wonderful fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder lady looked in Val&#8217;s handsome, earnest
young face, with a very motherly smile, as
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see, Sibyl. I&#8217;ve no doubt the boys
are right. It won&#8217;t do any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pocketbook was opened, but it was nearly
empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; remarked Bar. &#8220;Now he must be
searched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to know a good deal for a fellow
of your age,&#8221; very loudly and roughly exclaimed
one of the bystanders. &#8220;We&#8217;d better look to
your case. Who are you, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You here, too, Mr. Bonnet?&#8221; was Bar&#8217;s
quick rejoinder. &#8220;Gentlemen, here&#8217;s another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
man that mustn&#8217;t get out of the car till the
money&#8217;s been found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bonnet&#8221; made a sudden movement, but
he found himself in the strong grasp of the big
man.</p>

<p>There was no manner of use in struggling, but
the latter asked our hero:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know these fellows, it seems; are you a
detective?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221; asked Bar.
&#8220;I never saw either of them before, but I know
that man for a professional pickpocket, and this
one for his bonnet&mdash;his bully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of &#8217;em&#8217;s got that money, then!&#8221; exclaimed
the big man. &#8220;Come, my fine fellow,
shell over. I knew the railroad company had
set detectives on the express trains, but I&#8217;d never
have taken them boys for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; exclaimed Val, indignantly; &#8220;I&#8217;m a son
of Dr. Randall Manning, of New York, and this
is my friend, Mr. Barnaby Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the big man. &#8220;Go by
any name you please. Only it&#8217;s a great credit to
the company, and I wonder they didn&#8217;t think of
it before.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>At the word &#8220;detective,&#8221; the two pickpockets
seemed to give the matter up, and in a minute
more the ladies had counted their returned
&#8220;valuables,&#8221; and declared them all right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Vernon,&#8221; said the big man to Bar,
&#8220;what are we to do with these men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put them in charge of the conductor,&#8221; said
Bar. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got another errand on hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>It happened, however, that when the conductor,
who speedily arrived, was appealed to, he at
once produced from another car, a &#8220;sure enough&#8221;
official detective, and the big man winked at Bar,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. You know just what to do.
Bill,&#8221; he added to one of his friends, &#8220;look at
that. Those two fellows would swear neither of
&#8217;em ever saw the other before, and yet we&#8217;ve
seen, with our own eyes, how one of &#8217;em catches
the birds, and the other&#8217;s right on hand to cage
&#8217;em. It&#8217;s just splendid, and it&#8217;s a great credit to
the company. I wonder they never thought of
it before. By-the-way, who was it shouted at
that pickpocket first?&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a hard question to answer.</p>

<p>The two ladies, not being by any means so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
&#8220;sharp&#8221; as the big man deemed himself, felt sure
that the boys looked more than a little annoyed
by the peculiar impression they seemed to have
created, and the elder turned and beckoned to
Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say,&#8221; she asked, as he came across
and bent forward towards her, &#8220;that you are a
son of Dr. Manning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was my father&#8217;s family physician at one
time. My name is Brayton. Ask your friend to
come over here. I must thank him for saving
me my money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar came readily enough, but he was a little
inclined to stand upon his dignity until he found
that Mrs. Brayton was quite disposed to accept
Val&#8217;s account of &#8220;himself and friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, indeed, the boys were both quite contented
to sit down with their new acquaintances,
and Mrs. Brayton was not many minutes in ascertaining
not only their present errand but their
after destination. Not that she learned either
from Bar, but Val was very much of a boy, and
ready to be communicative with a &#8220;former
patient of his father.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>&#8220;Going to school at Ogleport Academy?&#8221; exclaimed
Sibyl. &#8220;Why, mother, how strange!
That is where George has gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother?&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Then we shall
make his acquaintance, of course. Is he older
than you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, a good deal,&#8221; laughed Sibyl. &#8220;He
has gone there as assistant principal, and I hope
he will make you mind him as well as I have to,
when he&#8217;s at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he such a severe fellow?&#8221; asked Val. &#8220;I
shall look out for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better,&#8221; said Sibyl, but her mother
added:</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel pretty sure he will do his duty, but
he&#8217;s not a man anybody need be afraid of.&#8221;</p>

<p>With so much of a foundation to go on, the
boys made fine headway with their remaining
conversation, nor were they at all disappointed
when the train at last reached their own destination,
to find that Mrs. Brayton and Sibyl were
also &#8220;at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>To be sure, Bar and Val had still a stage ride
of some miles to the little village on the coast
where they were to do their fishing, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
promised to run over and call on their new
friends before returning to the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole, Bar,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;and thanks
to you, this has been about the tallest bit of railway
riding I ever did in my life.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Dryer</span> and his trustees did not care to
remain for any great length of time after the
opening of what, in their eyes, were little better
than scientific toys and curiosities, so that before
the close of the day George Brayton and the
boys were left in sole possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to leave all these things out
here on the tables over night?&#8221; said Zeb Fuller,
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have time to put them away in
proper order,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;We must have
some new cupboards made expressly for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they might get injured,&#8221; said Zeb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any danger of that?&#8221; asked Brayton.
&#8220;Who&#8217;d want to hurt them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, exactly,&#8221; replied Zeb, &#8220;only it
seems a risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are any of the smaller boys mischievous?&#8221;
asked Brayton. &#8220;If they are, I&#8217;ll tell you how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to fix it. Just let it be understood that this lot
of apparatus is the special property of the older
boys of Ogleport, and that you mean to take
care of it. None of it&#8217;ll run away. It can&#8217;t even
fly as well as Dr. Dryer&#8217;s cows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb blushed to his ears, but Hy Allen responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what, Mr. Brayton, that&#8217;s just the
thing. We&#8217;ll whale the skin off any boy that
meddles with our appyrattus. Boys, let&#8217;s take a
good look at the windows before we go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a boy in Ogleport that&#8217;d touch
one of them things,&#8221; exclaimed Bill Jones. &#8220;Zeb
and Hy and me can answer for that, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill hesitated, and Brayton said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any hard cases among the
boarders, then? We can have our cupboards
finished by the time they get here, but they might
break &#8217;em open. Then where&#8217;d all our experiments
go to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t tell who&#8217;s coming and who ain&#8217;t, just yet,
but we&#8217;ll keep an eye on &#8217;em when they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; replied Brayton. &#8220;If you fellows&#8217;ll
go in with me we can have a grand time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of it, this fall and winter. You see, I&#8217;m a good
deal of a stranger yet, and I shall have to ask
your advice about a good many things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be on hand!&#8221; exclaimed Hy Allen.
&#8220;If you want to know anything about Ogleport,
you just ask Zeb Fuller. It&#8217;s just the same as if
you&#8217;d asked the whole crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; explained Zeb, &#8220;we village boys all
pull together, and sometimes the rest don&#8217;t know
enough to agree with us. That&#8217;s where they get
into trouble, you know, and old Sol&mdash;the Rev.
Dr. Dryer, I mean&mdash;he used to side with them
generally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then he got into trouble, eh?&#8221; laughed
Brayton. &#8220;Well, now I think our goods are
safe enough for to-night. We&#8217;ll get better acquainted
with them and with each other one of
these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brayton was preparing to close and lock the
door behind them all, as he spoke, and in a
moment more he was striding away across the
green towards the house of Dr. Dryer.</p>

<p>Zeb Fuller stood at the foot of the steps, looking
after Brayton till he was out of hearing, and
then he turned to his friends with:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>&#8220;Boys, that&#8217;s the kind of teacher I like. Not
the slightest sign of insubordination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a trump!&#8221; exclaimed Hy.</p>

<p>To this declaration, which expressed more
clearly than Zeb had done the popular verdict,
there was an audible hum of assent, and Bill
Jones added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe! Why, Zeb Fuller, them gimcracks in
there are as safe as if they were in a church.
Nobody will dream of touching them unless &#8217;twas
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve my doubts,&#8221; said Zeb, profoundly. &#8220;No
village is safe where there&#8217;s such a raft of ministers
and deacons and doctors and trustees and
such. We must do our duty, boys. Oh, but
wouldn&#8217;t I like to try a chemical experiment on
old Sol!&#8221;</p>

<p>The conclave broke up amid a storm of suggestions,
but Zeb was probably thinking of something
which could be done with a retort.</p>

<p>As for Mr. George Brayton, that vigorous
young gentleman had remarked to himself, as he
walked away:</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re rather above the average, take the
whole lot, through, and that Zeb Fuller is no ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
boy. Now that I have him the rest will
follow like a flock of sheep. I must do what I can
to make a man of Zeb, but I hope I&#8217;m not such a
fool as to try to cork him up. He&#8217;d burst the
whole Academy. No wonder Dr. Dryer&#8217;s afraid
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brayton did not look as if he were likely to
be very much afraid of anything in particular,
and he had just won the only complete victory
that had ever been gained over the boys of Ogleport.</p>

<p>Even then, however, he would not have been
astonished if he had overheard Zeb&#8217;s last remarks
to Hy and Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, boys, that&#8217;s Brayton&#8217;s end of the
Academy. Now, we must go to work on old Sol
and the main building. There&#8217;s plenty of room
for improvement there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very likely, but scarcely of the kind contemplated
by Zebedee Fuller.</p>

<p>Thenceforward, for several days, the tide of
human events rolled onward peacefully enough
for the people of Ogleport.</p>

<p>George Brayton learned, without a tremor of
dissatisfaction, the adverse decision of Mrs. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Dryer. She had never smiled so sweetly or exhibited
her false teeth to such entire perfection
as when she recommended him to Mrs. Wood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>If Effie herself would have been better pleased
with the idea of such excellent company in the
house, she at least said nothing about it. Her
only remark on the subject was:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Brayton, somebody ought to warn
you. Are you afraid of ghosts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the Wood&#8217;s mansion is said to be
haunted. The ghosts never come in pleasant
weather, but the first frost brings them back
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spend their summers at the watering-places,
do they?&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;Very fashionable
ghosts, I should say, these!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very, only they have sometimes scared away
boarders for Mrs. Wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what I&#8217;ll do if they trouble me,&#8221;
said Brayton.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Effie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll set Zeb Fuller and his boys after
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would do,&#8221; laughed Effie, merrily. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
do believe if Zeb Fuller met a ghost he&#8217;d insist
on shaking hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very much that kind of a boy,&#8221; said
Brayton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve engaged him and Hy Allen and
half-a-dozen more of the same class to assist me
in keeping the Academy in order this fall and
winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Effie opened her eyes, but she comprehended
the strategy of the new teacher, and that was
more than Mrs. Dryer or her husband could have
done.</p>

<p>The afternoon that Brayton moved his goods
and chattels to the widow&#8217;s house, Mrs. Dryer
remarked to the doctor:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have double responsibility this winter.
I see clearly how it&#8217;ll be. Mr. Brayton lacks
dignity. He&#8217;ll have no control, whatever. Those
boys&#8217;ll ride right over him. I heard him speak
to that Fuller boy to-day, and he actually touched
his hat to him, just as if he&#8217;d been a trustee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Dryer groaned, but he searched his mind in
vain for a recollection of the occasion when
George Brayton had exhibited that amount of
reverence for the principal of the Academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall undoubtedly be compelled to exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
especial vigilance,&#8221; he calmly replied, &#8220;but I consider
myself competent to confront the emergency.&#8221;</p>

<p>Splendid words they were, and the longest that
occurred to him at the moment, but his better-half,
that is, his &#8220;third,&#8221; was hardly comforted, even
while she admired.</p>

<p>There were other houses in Ogleport which
would gladly have opened their doors to such a
boarder as George Brayton, but he was wise for
so young a man, and most of them contained only
too many of the things classed as &#8220;comforts of a
home&#8221;&mdash;even sons and grown-up daughters.</p>

<p>So he took Mrs. Dryer&#8217;s advice and decided to
sojourn with the Widow Wood.</p>

<p>Fat and active and fussy was the widow, bearing
her three-score years lightly enough, though
with a dim idea that she was the oldest inhabitant
of Ogleport, and, by good rights, the most important
person in the village.</p>

<p>Old Judge Wood had been a great man in his
day, at least in his own estimation.</p>

<p>He had meant to found a fortune and a family,
but had somehow failed to do either.</p>

<p>He had, however, built the biggest and costliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
house in all that region of country, and then
had died before he had put the second coat of
paint on it.</p>

<p>He left his widow so nearly just enough to
squeeze along on, that she had never seen her
way clearly to that second coat of paint, or indeed,
to any other sort of finishing up, and the
great roomy mansion had held up its bare, square
nakedness of weather-beaten pine, on the gentle
slope towards the little river, for a quarter of a
century.</p>

<p>Even the trees refused to keep very close company
with such a curious embodiment of ancient
respectability, and all the winds of heaven, as well
as all the hot summer suns, had the fairest kind
of a chance at it.</p>

<p>Still, the Wood mansion was by all odds the
best boarding house in Ogleport, for its lady-owner
was a notable housekeeper, and had a
special pride in the character of her guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haunted!&#8221; said George Brayton to himself,
when he had finished unpacking his books in the
big, second-floor front room, of which the widow
made him temporary lord. &#8220;Haunted! It looks
very much like it. But I don&#8217;t wonder the ghosts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
keep out of it in summer. There&#8217;s a perfect
glare of light in it, from one end to the other.
She doesn&#8217;t seem to suspect what the blinds were
made for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb Fuller had struck a new idea that day.
He had happened along in front of the Widow
Wood&#8217;s, as Zeb was very apt to happen along,
just when Brayton was making his transfer, and
he had promptly offered his services.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Zeb, thank you,&#8221; replied Brayton. &#8220;Just
carry up those dumb-bells to my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pointing finger left no doubt as to what
was meant, but Zeb incautiously remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw that kind of a hammer before.
What&#8217;s it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The explanation that followed, with incidental
references to Indian clubs, boxing-gloves, lifting
machines and baseball, was a sort of a new revelation
to the Ogleport champion, and Brayton
had unconsciously completed the conquest he had
so well begun at the lecture-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who ever heard before,&#8221; thought Zeb, &#8220;of a
teacher who knew more than any of the boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time any such phenomena had
been seen in Ogleport.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&#8220;Fact,&#8221; he said to himself; &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to
be afraid we ain&#8217;t able to teach him anything.
Seems so very ready and willing to learn, too.
Very different from old Sol.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was walking down the street, half an hour
later, when he was hailed by Hy Allen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeb, did y&#8217;hear &#8217;bout Puff Evans&#8217;s boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, what of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold on execution, to-morrow, down in front
of Runner&#8217;s tavern. Don&#8217;t I wish I could buy
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful hard on Puff,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;He made
it himself, and it&#8217;s the best boat on the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t fetch much,&#8221; said Hy. &#8220;Sorry for
Puff. It&#8217;s just a game of some of them lawyers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, we&#8217;d better be there,&#8221; said Zeb.
&#8220;Maybe we can bid it up a little for Puff. How&#8217;ll
he ever go a-fishing without it? Then, if Puff
can&#8217;t fish, he&#8217;ll die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon that&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Hy. &#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps they&#8217;d
ha&#8217; levied on him, on&#8217;y the boat&#8217;s worth more&#8217;n
he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sell for more in Ogleport,&#8221; remarked Zeb.
&#8220;Puff&#8217;s the best fisherman on the lake, but I
wouldn&#8217;t care to own him. Now, Hy, I&#8217;ve got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
something more to tell you &#8217;bout the new teacher.
I&#8217;ve taken that young man right in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope he&#8217;ll turn out better than old Sol,&#8221; said
Hy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hiram,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Solomon&#8217;s a
failure. I give him up, but I&#8217;ve great hopes of
George Brayton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hy was quite ready to listen, for every day
was bringing the fall term nearer, and school
matters were assuming a place of first-class importance
in the minds of the boys of Ogleport.</p>

<small>A SHARPER OUTWITTED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bar</span> and Val had a splendid time at the seashore.
Never before had the former passed a
week of such thoroughgoing enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was grand fun to catch fish; the very sailing
and rowing were a kind of new life; every
crab and clam they laid their hands on was a
sort of new wonder. Still, if Bar had tried to analyze
his feelings he would have found that, after
all, the secret of his happiness was the fact that
his &#8220;new time&#8221; was daily becoming more and
more of a clear and clean and beautiful reality.</p>

<p>Val Manning was capital company, and they
made more than one trip to the quiet and pleasant
little home of Mrs. Brayton and Sibyl. The
widow, for such she was, seemed always glad to
see them, and Sibyl was sure to have something
more to tell them about &#8220;George,&#8221; who seemed,
indeed, to be a sort of human idol in the mind
of his very pretty sister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>That sort of thing, nice as it was, had an end at
last, and Bar experienced a halfway gloomy sensation
at finding himself once more on his way to
the great city.</p>

<p>Their stay there was to be brief, as previously
decided, but Bar had one more good, long talk
with the judge and the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said the former, &#8220;that you could
open your valise now, but that&#8217;s impossible. I
wouldn&#8217;t have you break your word for anything.
I&#8217;ll tell you, however, one thing I wish you&#8217;d do.
Every time you recall, or think you do, anything
that happened away back, before you began to
live with Major Montague, I wish you would
write it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he been to see you while I was gone?&#8221;
asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he was in my office once while I was
out,&#8221; replied the judge; &#8220;but he must have seen
something or somebody there he didn&#8217;t like, for
he hasn&#8217;t turned up since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not a man to give up anything,&#8221; said
Bar; &#8220;but he can hardly find me as far away as
Ogleport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said the doctor; &#8220;and now, Barnaby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
we both hope you will give a good account of
yourself at the Academy. You will have to study
pretty hard at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Val knows a great
many things that I have never heard of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your courage up, though,&#8221; said Judge
Danvers. &#8220;I mean to make a lawyer of you one
of these days. You&#8217;re just built for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kind friends they were, and Bar felt a curious
glow at his heart twenty times before he and Val
got away, as he found how well and thoughtfully
his various wants had been foreseen and provided
for.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll spend the whole of that thousand dollars,&#8221;
said Bar to himself, &#8220;before he gets through
with me. Well, I&#8217;ll pay him, somehow, some day.
Meantime I&#8217;ll be a right good friend to Val. He&#8217;s
a tip-top sort of a fellow, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Val, that young gentleman could hardly
find words to tell his mother all his satisfaction
with his wonderful new chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows everything but books, mother,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and you couldn&#8217;t get him to do a mean
thing. I&#8217;m ever so glad he&#8217;s going with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there came a leave-taking, which made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Bar sick with the thought of what a wonderful
thing it is to have a live father and mother. Then
there followed an all-night ride, by rail, then a
morning change of cars, and then a stage that
took the two schoolboys to Ogleport from a direction
opposite to that by which George Brayton
had reached the same destination.</p>

<p>The &#8220;stage&#8221; was a long-bodied, flat-topped,
four seated vehicle, that, in that warm weather,
was left open to the dust and surrounding scenery
on all sides. The boys had the back seat, wide
enough for three, and immediately in front of
them was a pair of decently well-dressed, middle-aged
men, who got in at one of the villages
through which they passed.</p>

<p>Neither of these gentry seemed to need more
than a glance at Bar and Val to fix their identity
as &#8220;Academy boys,&#8221; and they talked away unreservedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said one, the sharper and harder-faced
of the two, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; straight through. Got
to stop at Ogleport and make sure of Puff Evans&#8217;s
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want of a boat?&#8221; asked his
companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>&#8220;Why, you know I bought in the Peters&#8217;s
place, up at the Rodney end of the lake, and I&#8217;m
going to move in this week. There&#8217;s a good
boat-house but no boat. Ain&#8217;t any good one
around, that I know of, except Puff&#8217;s, so I laid
for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but then he wouldn&#8217;t sell it for any
money. Made it himself, and it&#8217;s worth fifty or
sixty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess likely, but it won&#8217;t cost me that. You
see, Puff goes on sprees every few months, and
he&#8217;s awful kerless about his tavern bills. So
I found one up in Rodney, bought it for most
nothing, sued and got judgment on it, and levied
on the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the judgment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Costs and all, fifteen dollars. Cost me about
five, and I&#8217;m willing to go five more. That&#8217;ll
make the boat net me ten dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheap enough. But s&#8217;pose Puff pays up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;ll trust him with that much money.
Besides, I can get another squeeze on him, if he
should. I&#8217;m bound to have that boat. The
stage&#8217;ll get in just about half an hour before the
time. It&#8217;ll be down at Runner&#8217;s tavern and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
can catch a ride home, or go up on the night
stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>It all sounded very businesslike and matter-of-course,
but Bar looked at Val with his finger
on his lip. Pretty much the same idea was passing
through both their busy heads.</p>

<p>They had not intended to do any eaves-dropping,
but they could scarcely have helped overhearing
what they had, and, when their luggage
was discharged at the Widow Wood&#8217;s, they astonished
that good old lady by clearing out,
within two minutes, on the plea of an important
errand in the village.</p>

<p>Runner&#8217;s tavern was away down at the northern
end of the main street, and was a curiously
dilapidated kind of a country hostelry. It had
been, however, time out of mind, the place
appointed for the performance of petty &#8220;constables&#8217;
sales,&#8221; and on this day, at noon, quite a
little crowd had assembled in front of it, less
with any idea of &#8220;bidding&#8221; than with a mild
curiosity to see what would become of Puff
Evans&#8217;s boat.</p>

<p>Puff himself had been on hand half the morning,
and had, with wonderful self-control for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
him, kept rigidly away from the door of the
tavern bar-room.</p>

<p>Tall, lank, red-headed, weak-faced, with a
strong tendency to wear his hands in his pockets
and to blow out his irresolute cheeks in the style
which had gained him his nickname, but for all
that Puff Evans had not a single personal enemy
in either Ogleport or Rodney.</p>

<p>Indeed, he received an abundance of sympathy
over the admitted hardness of his case, especially
from the boys.</p>

<p>Thus far, however, Puff had been utterly unable
to crystallize that sympathy into anything
that resembled coin or bank-notes, and he was
now standing with his shoeless feet wide apart,
mournfully gazing at the &#8220;notice of sale&#8221; which
his moderate learning did not enable him to read.</p>

<p>Zeb Fuller was on hand as a matter of course,
and well backed up, too, so far as numbers went,
but Zeb&#8217;s pocket was only a very little better
off, in that emergency, than Puff&#8217;s own, though
with fewer holes in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is mighty hard on Puff, isn&#8217;t it, Gershom?&#8221;
said Zeb to the fat old miller, as the
latter waddled dignifiedly past the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>&#8220;What is it, Zeb? Come here,&#8221; replied the
miller. &#8220;Do you want to buy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only to keep Puff Evans from drowning
himself,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;It&#8217;s only fifteen dollars,
and the boat&#8217;s worth four times that much. I&#8217;ve
got three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you the other twelve!&#8221; exclaimed
Gershom Todderley, pulling out his wallet, &#8220;and
you and I can own the boat together till you can
pay me. We can let Puff use it, can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;You&#8217;re
an honor to Ogleport, Brother Todderley.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gershom looked at the incorrigible youngster
with a very dignified sort of wheeze, but Zeb
went back to the crowd feeling like a Rothschild.</p>

<p>In a moment more the customary and monotonous,
&#8220;How much&#8217;m I offered,&#8221; was responded
to by a bid of five dollars from the Rodney attorney,
who had &#8220;come for that boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five, goin&#8217; at five&mdash;five&mdash;do I hear any
more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten,&#8221; responded Zeb.</p>

<p>The Rodney man started and looked hard at
Zeb.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>&#8220;No bids from boys,&#8221; he began, but the auctioneer
promptly responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;If Zeb Fuller&#8217;s a boy, whar&#8217;d General Jackson
git his army. Ten, ten&mdash;going at ten&mdash;do I
hear any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve!&#8221; shouted Zeb, and then he added,
&#8220;Won&#8217;t do, Skinner, my boy; I&#8217;d never forgive
myself if I let you go a boating and get
drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirteen!&#8221; exclaimed Skinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen!&#8221; from Zeb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen, goin&#8217; at fourteen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen and a &#8217;alf!&#8221; from Skinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen!&#8221; said Zeb, quickly, but with a shivery
sort of feeling that he had got to the end of
his rope.</p>

<p>The Rodney attorney was inclined to dally a
little, and the auctioneer came very near knocking
down the prize to Zeb before that fatal
&#8220;&#8217;alf&#8221; was added that carried him out of his
depth.</p>

<p>If he had only had time to call for a collection
of quarters from among the boys, or to make another
pull on old Gershom Todderley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>Nobody else looked as if they intended to dispute
the matter, and lawyer Skinner began to
think he would get his boat cheap enough, when
a clear, strong, though somewhat boyish voice,
capped the last bid with: &#8220;Sixteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>And all eyes were turned towards the newcomer,
while Skinner growled:</p>

<p>&#8220;More boys? Come, now, this won&#8217;t do, Mr.
What&#8217;s-your-name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Cash,&#8221; quietly responded Bar
Vernon, as the auctioneer went on with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen, sixteen! do I hear any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seventeen!&#8221; said Skinner, raspishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty,&#8221; responded Bar; &#8220;let&#8217;s make it interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-one,&#8221; shouted the now exasperated
Skinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two!&#8221; said Bar, and even Zeb
Fuller gave a shout of exultation and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Skinner, my son, you&#8217;ve got to give full value
for that ark if you get it. You ain&#8217;t so much in
danger of drowning as you was.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Rodney lawyer had no idea of any
such wickedness as paying full value for that or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
any other thing, and the auctioneer hammered
away in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Zeb, encouragingly&mdash;&#8220;come,
Skinner, my dear fellow, if a man&#8217;s drowned
he&#8217;ll never be hung. It&#8217;s your best chance. Try
him again. Say three, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Skinner was getting sulky over his defeat,
and, before he could quite make up his mind to
raise the bid, the hammer fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name?&#8221; said the auctioneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cash,&#8221; said Barnaby, and the &#8220;best boat on
the lake&#8221; was all his own.</p>

<p>That is, he and Val Manning owned it between
them, for they had decided to &#8220;go halves&#8221; on the
purchase-money.</p>

<p>As for Lawyer Skinner, that gentleman somewhat
rapidly withdrew himself from the gaze of
the crowd of boys and the tantalizing remarks
of Zeb Fuller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Cash,&#8221; said Zeb to our hero,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve got the boat, but who&#8217;s to pay Puff
Evans&#8217;s funeral expenses, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one is he?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman yonder that reminds you of
Daniel Webster,&#8221; said Zeb, pointing at the half-stunned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and altogether bewildered builder of the
boat. &#8220;I&#8217;ve some business to attend to over at
the mill, but I&#8217;ll call for the coroner on my way
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying he was off, without waiting for Bar&#8217;s
reply, for his disappointment with reference to
that boat had been the severest blow Zeb had
received for many a day. Besides, he was really
anxious to return the miller&#8217;s money with as little
delay as might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Puff,&#8221; said Bar, as he walked up to that
worthy, &#8220;where&#8217;s the boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down t&#8217; the lake. Right by my house,&#8221; replied
Puff, vacantly. &#8220;She&#8217;s a beauty, but all the
money I had in the world was ten dollars. Skinner&#8217;s
as mean as pusley, but I don&#8217;t know as I
blame you. Going to bring her over to town and
put her in Todderley&#8217;s pond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bad as that,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Do you
suppose you know enough to take good care of
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Puff, &#8220;I built her myself, and
she&#8217;s just the neatest little thing. Mast and sail,
too. Runs as if she was greased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;what&#8217;ll you charge me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
keep her for me? You to use her all the time,
same as if you owned her, and I to have her
once in awhile to go fishing in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charge?&#8221; exclaimed Puff, opening his eyes.
&#8220;Charge? You git eout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;you go back home
and look sharp after that boat. One of these
days I&#8217;ll come over and take a look at her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, mister!&#8221; exclaimed Puff, as the advantages
of Bar&#8217;s proposition slowly dawned on
him, &#8220;won&#8217;t ye come in and take suthin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a drop,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;nor you won&#8217;t,
either. That&#8217;s the way you lost your boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fact, mister,&#8221; said Puff, &#8220;but I tell ye what.
I&#8217;d like to have a sheer in that boat. Won&#8217;t ye
let me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll keep dark
about it. If lawyer Skinner knew it he&#8217;d be
after it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say ten dollars&#8217; wuth, then,&#8221; said Puff.
&#8220;&#8217;Pears like I couldn&#8217;t ketch no fish in another
man&#8217;s boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Call it ten dollars&#8217;
worth, if that&#8217;ll do you any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, then,&#8221; said Puff, drawing himself up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
straighter than he had done before during that
day, &#8220;there&#8217;s the money, cash down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind that,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;pay when
you get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ye don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Puff. &#8220;Take that, or I
shan&#8217;t feel honest. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; comin&#8217; to
me from the sale over&#8217;n above the jedgment. I
shan&#8217;t go home empty. I ain&#8217;t sure but what it&#8217;s
a pooty good job for me, anyhow, and old Skinner&#8217;s
beat, too; I&#8217;m right down glad o&#8217; that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar consented to take the money, and he and
Val returned to Mrs. Wood&#8217;s, congratulating
themselves on the splendid beginning they had
made for their fun at Ogleport.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can fish pretty much all the time till
school opens,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;and then there&#8217;s evenings
and Saturdays after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t want to fish all our spare time,&#8221;
said Bar. &#8220;There must be piles and piles of
things to make fun out of around such a place as
this is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So there are,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;but we mustn&#8217;t be
careless of our money. I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve beaten
that rascally lawyer as cheaply as we have. I
mean to write my father all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;d have done it himself, I know,&#8221; said
Bar.</p>

<p>There could be small doubt of that.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF THE DUN HEIFER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Brother Todderley,&#8221;</span> said Zeb to the
miller, &#8220;we&#8217;re defeated in our benevolent intentions.
Puff&#8217;s boat went for twenty-two dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who got it?&#8221; asked the miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bloated young aristocrat from the city,&#8221;
said Zeb. &#8220;I suspect him of being one of the
new boarders. The Academy&#8217;s going to ruin,
Gershom. There&#8217;s your twelve dollars, with my
sincere thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, Zeb, very sorry,&#8221; remarked the miller;
but another voice broke in with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d ha&#8217; thought that of him? Thryin&#8217; to
rob a poor chap like Poof Evans! It&#8217;s worrus
than wantin&#8217; to dhrown old Docther Dhryer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patrick Murphy,&#8221; replied Zeb, &#8220;what do you
know about war? Hullo, there goes poor Puff
on his way home. I haven&#8217;t the heart even to
try and comfort him. Tell you what I&#8217;ll do,
Brother Todderley, I&#8217;ll give my share towards
buying him the timber to build another boat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good boy, Zeb,&#8221; responded the
miller. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do my share, and he can have anything
he wants out of my lumber. Do you hear
that, Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Troth an&#8217; I do, sor,&#8221; replied Pat. &#8220;Wull it
be the crukked shticks I&#8217;ll give him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crooked sticks!&#8221; exclaimed the miller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure an&#8217; he&#8217;s one of &#8217;em,&#8221; said Pat. &#8220;He
niver&#8217;d worruk well with straight ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Pat,&#8221; replied Zeb, &#8220;it&#8217;s a solemn
thing for Puff. Just look at him. I never saw
him walk so fast before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indade,&#8221; said Pat, &#8220;it&#8217;s ginerally walkin&#8217; behind
he&#8217;s been iver since I&#8217;ve known him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plenty of sympathy poor Puff was getting,
though he knew it not, but it would all have been
too late to save his boat for him if it had not
been for Bar and Val.</p>

<p>These latter had put in their time, before dinner,
in a very vigorous process of taking possession
of their room, which was all a schoolboy
could or should have asked for, though hardly as
luxurious in its aspect or appliances as the one
Val Manning had been accustomed to at home.</p>

<p>As for Bar Vernon, he had seen all sorts of accommodations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in his day, and was disposed to
take a rose-colored view of every item belonging
to his present quarters.</p>

<p>By dinner-time the boys were in a high state
of preparation for it, so far as appetite went, but
they were hardly expecting the sort of company
that awaited them on their entering the dining-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Manning! Mr. Vernon! My name is
Brayton. Glad to see you both. My mother
and sister have written me about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a bit of a surprise to find that their
teacher was also to be their fellow-boarder, but
neither Val nor Bar was the kind of boy to repel
so very frank and kindly a greeting.</p>

<p>In fact, before the meal was over, Brayton had
even heard the story of the boat, as well as Bar&#8217;s
repeated lamentations over his deficiencies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up into my room,&#8221; he said, with reference
to the latter. &#8220;I can hardly advise
you what to do till we&#8217;ve had some further
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up they went, and they saw quite enough, at
once, to give them a good opinion of their new
friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Bar picked up a book which was lying on the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;French,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;One of George
Sands&#8217;s novels. One of these days you&#8217;ll get
ready to take hold of such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Val, &#8220;he&#8217;s picked up French.
He talked German, too, for an hour at a time,
with an old fellow we met at the seashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; exclaimed Brayton. &#8220;Do you know
anything of Greek or Latin, Mr. Vernon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not a word; but I understand Spanish,
and can talk it a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;English, French, German, Spanish, at seventeen!
That&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;m not afraid of the rest.
Your trouble won&#8217;t be in languages, but you&#8217;ve
plenty of work cut out for you. I&#8217;ll take you in
hand, at once, myself. Three hours&#8217; study a
day, my young friend, from now till school
opens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the fishing, Bar,&#8221; exclaimed Val,
mournfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;To-morrow
morning, Bar, you are to take your Latin grammar
with you and go to the lake. I&#8217;ll hear you
recite when you get home. Next day, Greek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Next, something else. Read right ahead, whether
you understand it or not. We&#8217;ll see about that
afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed a curious way to begin with a new
scholar, but it was the only method Brayton
could think of for finding out precisely where
Bar was, intellectually, and what he had better
try to do with him. Such an odd fish of a
scholar he had never before come in contact with.</p>

<p>That afternoon the boys went over to the
Academy with their new friend, and became as
well posted as Zeb Fuller himself in the quantities
and qualities of the various apparatus, old as
well as new. Val took Bar, while Brayton was
busy in the lecture-room, and showed him over
the whole building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you cut your name anywhere?&#8221; asked
Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;but every boy is expected to
before he goes away. If he does it too soon they
expel him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; laughed Bar. &#8220;Is that the bell-rope?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were near the great front door of the
main hall as he spoke, and Val answered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, but I wonder what it&#8217;s down for. If
Zeb Fuller knew it there&#8217;d be music before
twelve o&#8217;clock to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Zeb Fuller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy that chaffed you about Puff Evans,&#8221;
said Val. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of the crowd that was too
much for me last term. He&#8217;s a queer duck, but
we must give him a lesson before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or he&#8217;ll give us one,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll
see about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val Manning was more than half right about
that bell-rope. Zeb Fuller did know that it was
&#8220;down,&#8221; and there was &#8220;music&#8221; before twelve
o&#8217;clock that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hiram Allen,&#8221; Zeb said to his next friend, as
they came back from driving the cows to pasture,
&#8220;this is a sad piece of business about Puff Evans
and his boat. I think the Academy bell ought to
be tolled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he won&#8217;t drown himself, after all,&#8221;
said Hy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. Indeed, I fear not,&#8221; replied Zeb;
&#8220;but he ought to, and so we must do our duty,
not only by him but by the bell. It must be
tolled, Hiram.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>&#8220;If we can get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ascertained the condition of one of the
front windows the day the new apparatus came,&#8221;
said Zeb.</p>

<p>That was quite enough, under the circumstances.
The people of Ogleport retired to
slumber as usual that night, only to be awakened
a little after eleven by a most unusual,
irregular, spasmodic chaos of sound from the one
bell in the village which they had last dreamed
of hearing from.</p>

<p>Bar and Val were both awakened by it, and
dressed themselves with a truly boyish instinct
that there was some kind of fun abroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it be?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeb Fuller, of course,&#8221; said Val; &#8220;only there
isn&#8217;t the least chance in the world of his being
caught at it. We must get out on the green and
see what we can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were joined on the stairs by George
Brayton, but he at once understood their entire
innocence in the matter of the bell.</p>

<p>A hideous, intermittent clamor was that which
was now pouring down from the old belfry, and
various half-dressed figures were beginning to flit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
through the moonlight that was pouring over the
wide and shadowy green.</p>

<p>One of these figures, full of extraordinary wisdom,
made its way straight to the front gate of
Deacon Fuller&#8217;s residence.</p>

<p>Hardly had a hand been laid upon the gate-latch,
however, before the door of the house
swung open and the agile form of Zebedee Fuller,
busily tugging at his half-donned trousers,
stood on the threshold, with his father close behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;The Rev. Dr.
Dryer? Isn&#8217;t there something the matter with
the Academy bell, doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter?&#8221; repeated the astonished principal.
&#8220;Are you really here? I freely confess that
the occurrence exceeds the moderate capacity
of my comprehension. Just listen to that
bell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something the matter with it, beyond a
doubt,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;It don&#8217;t toll as if it was
meant for a funeral. If it is, I should say that
funeral had been drinking too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Dryer could not wait for any more of Zeb
Fuller&#8217;s moralizing, but pulled his cotton night-cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
closer over his ears as he hurried away
towards the Academy.</p>

<p>Others, less thoughtful than himself of the
probable source of all Ogleport mischief, had
directed their steps and energies to what seemed
the sure capture of the untimely bell-ringer,
whoever he might be.</p>

<p>There came in the puzzle.</p>

<p>Not a door was open, front or rear. Every
window was closed. There was not a sign of
human entrance about the entire exterior of the
Academy building.</p>

<p>George Brayton had the key of the rear entrance,
but even while some of the rest had gone
for lights, the doctor arrived, and with him the
means of throwing open the great front doors.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, a flood of splendid moonlight
was poured in upon the mystery&mdash;only moonshine
leaves every mystery as badly off as it
finds it.</p>

<p>There, in the middle of the main hall, from
which on either side the schoolrooms opened, a
few paces only from the front doorway, stood
Dr. Dryer&#8217;s favorite dun heifer, with the bell-rope
firmly webbed around her horns and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
peck-measure of green apples on the floor within
what would have been easy reach but for the
hindrance of that rope.</p>

<p>Small blame to the heifer if she smelled those
apples and strove to reach them, and even less to
the rope and the bell if among them they waked
up all Ogleport as a consequence.</p>

<p>Loud and long laughed the hitherto indignant
representatives of the Board of Trustees. Clear
and ringing was the laugh of George Brayton.
Only less decided was that of Val Manning, but
Bar Vernon was as mute as Dr. Dryer himself,
and did but move around and look and search
and study, for he had unconsciously undertaken
the problem which was shortly to baffle entirely
the mental acumen of his elders.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did that heifer get into the Academy?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was not a dissenting voice, when some
one suggested:</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee Fuller!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dr. Dryer had already ascertained that
the evil genius of Ogleport had been at home and
in bed, and, granting as an axiom his agency in
the matter, the question clouded down upon
them with a yet more Egyptian darkness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_200.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">How Did Zeb Fuller Get That Heifer Into the Academy?</span>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>&#8220;How did Zeb Fuller get that heifer into the
Academy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor had released his tantalized property
quickly enough, and there were boys at hand to
volunteer her escort to her own &#8220;lot,&#8221; but he
himself remained to grapple with the mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only one safety just now,&#8221; remarked Brayton.
&#8220;We must take away the rope altogether
till school begins. I&#8217;ll go up and do it at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>Val&#8217;s services were also offered, but Dr. Dryer
remarked that &#8220;two would be as large a number
as the occasion demanded,&#8221; and Val was compelled
to remain below.</p>

<p>The steeple was not a very lofty affair, but
there was some climbing to be done, nevertheless,
and both Bar and Brayton paused for breath on
a sort of &#8220;deck,&#8221; twenty feet at least above the
ridge of the main building, and as many more
below the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this wheel for?&#8221; asked Bar, as he
closely scrutinized a bit of machinery firmly set
on the deck. &#8220;It seems not to be used.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like an old tolling gear,&#8221; said Brayton.
&#8220;There&#8217;s another pulley-wheel to match it, up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
there by the bell, I fancy. They&#8217;ve changed the
gearing now, and don&#8217;t use this any more. That&#8217;s
a pokerish sort of place to climb into by moonlight,
and those cleats are frail things to step on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lighter than you are,&#8221; said Bar, and,
without another word, up he went.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no ordinary boy,&#8221; said Brayton to
himself, and in another minute or so the rope,
disengaged from the bell-gearing, came rattling
down upon the deck beside him, and could be
slipped through to the lower floors and removed
beyond the reach of mysterious heifers and evil-disposed
boys.</p>

<p>Bar followed the rope quickly, and George
Brayton&#8217;s keen eyes noted with what an easy,
confident, unhesitating movement the boy glided
down the frail and quivering framework.</p>

<p>The Academy bell-tower had been standing a
long time, and, although it was stanch enough,
it could hardly be called immovable.</p>

<p>The greatest trial of that night to the Rev. Dr.
Dryer was the fact that Zebedee Fuller had been
in bed, and that so he had no decent excuse for
any attempt to question him concerning the
misdeeds of the dun heifer.</p>

<small>A MESS OF FISH</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning, at breakfast, Mrs. Wood&#8217;s
boarders found a capital mess of fresh perch
and pickerel on the table, and she remarked to
them:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are eating Mr. Vernon&#8217;s fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Mrs. Wood, &#8220;Puff Evans came
to the door with them, ready cleaned, by the
time we were up, and left them with his respects
to Mr. Vernon. He said, too, that the boat was
all right and ready for use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you cooked them for me,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;Well, thank you for that, and I must say it
looks well on Puff&#8217;s part. Shall we bring home
whatever fish we catch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mrs. Wood, &#8220;and Puff may
bring as many pickerel as he pleases. They&#8217;re
always welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were, indeed, that morning, for it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
as if the previous night&#8217;s disturbance had distributed
unusually keen appetites all around the
table.</p>

<p>Bar and Val were quite ready to take advantage
of Puff&#8217;s hint about the boat, and George
Brayton frankly declared his regret at not being
able to go with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only, Mr. Vernon,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you must not
let your fishing prevent you from doing something
with your grammar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bar, and then even Mrs. Wood
became interested in so very unusual a method
of attempting the intricacies of the Latin tongue.</p>

<p>At that very hour, however, a brace of active-looking
youths were slowly descending the hillside
from the cow pastures, and one said to another:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hiram Allen, that was very remarkable conduct
on the part of Solomon&#8217;s dun heifer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; replied Hy; &#8220;but, Zeb, don&#8217;t you
suppose they suspect us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they do,&#8221; said Zeb; &#8220;but I&#8217;ve the
dun heifer&#8217;s word of honor that she won&#8217;t tell
how she got into the Academy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she won&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said Hy, thoughtfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
&#8220;but it would be a rough thing on you and me
if we got found out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Solomon took care of that with his customary
wisdom,&#8221; said Zeb; &#8220;he came right over to our
house and made himself sure that I had been in
my peaceful couch all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better keep it, even from the boys, unless
it&#8217;s Bill Jones,&#8221; said Hy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Zeb, &#8220;the dun heifer,
though a brute, is far more trustworthy than any
human being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every breakfast-table in Ogleport was busy
with the bell mystery that morning, and the
unanimity with which all minds seemed in search
of a clue which would guide them in the direction
of Deacon Fuller&#8217;s house was a high testimonial
to the well-earned fame of the deacon&#8217;s
heir.</p>

<p>It was only, however, at the coffee-urn of the
Academy principal that anything like gloom
interfered with the pervading cheerfulness of
tone which the common difficulty seemed to be
met.</p>

<p>Euphemia would have been as smiling as a
June sunrise about it, and even the doctor would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
speedily have recovered from his temporary depression,
but Mrs. Dryer failed to discern any
ray of comfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a piece of outrageous and unparalleled
defiance,&#8221; she assured her husband and stepdaughter,
for the three-and-thirtieth time.
&#8220;Your influence and authority in this community
will be permanently compromised unless you
succeed in probing this matter to the very bottom
and bringing the lawless perpetrators to
condign justice. Why, Dr. Dryer, that unfortunate
heifer might have pulled down the
bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am compelled to admit the possibility of
such a termination of her efforts to liberate herself,&#8221;
moodily responded the doctor, unmindful
of Effie&#8217;s suggestion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Or to get at the apples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The entire operation,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;is enveloped
in impenetrable mystery. I am anxious
to ascertain if Mr. Brayton has evolved any
probable solution. He afterwards ascended to
the belfry to remove the rope from its attachments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brayton!&#8221; scornfully exclaimed Mrs. Dryer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t learn anything till you get it
from him! Why, I&#8217;m expecting every day
to hear that the boys have begun to call him
George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Doctor; you won&#8217;t have a cow or
a bell or an Academy, or anything else, before
the end of this term, if you don&#8217;t manage somehow
to accomplish something.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no denying that the exigency was
one that called for special exertion, but Effie
Dryer had seen George Brayton prying around
the Academy building very early that morning,
and she would have given more than her stepmother
seemed disposed to for a statement of his
views concerning the heifer and the bell. It had
already been ascertained that the peck measure
was the doctor&#8217;s own, but no one had succeeded
in identifying what remained of the green apples.</p>

<p>Meantime, on his way back from his errand of
gratitude that morning, Puff Evans had been
hailed by Pat Murphy from the door of the grist-mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The top o&#8217; the mornin&#8217; to yez. It&#8217;s sorry I
am to hear the bad news about yer boat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>&#8220;My boat?&#8221; responded Puff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis,&#8221; said Pat, &#8220;and the master towld me
to offer yez the pick of his lumber yon, ave ye
was minded to build another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what for?&#8221; asked Puff. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the
boat a good one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; said Pat; &#8220;she&#8217;s only too good
for a Rodney lawyer. I hope she&#8217;ll upset wid
him the day he puts his foot in her.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Puff began to comprehend the
state of his neighbor&#8217;s mind on the boat question,
and he at once proceeded to an explanation
which made the kind-hearted Irishman break out
into all sorts of encomiums upon the &#8220;young jintleman
from the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Puff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thrue for you,&#8221; said Pat, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s mesilf
would like to do the good turn for him. He&#8217;ll
have frinds to the fore in Ogleport, or I&#8217;m mishtaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed he will,&#8221; said Puff, very emphatically,
for him, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll teach him all there is
to learn about boatin&#8217; and fishin&#8217; in these
parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yersilf knows it all thin,&#8221; said Pat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
he went back to his grist with a muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wondher ave Zeb Fuller and the b&#8217;yes know
about that same.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> more than a mile from the outermost
homes of Ogleport, in a direct line, lay
Skanigo Lake.</p>

<p>A beautiful sparkling sheet of water was
Skanigo, and it always mixed itself up, somehow,
with Puff Evans&#8217;s ideas of Paradise; but the Rev.
Dr. Solomon Dryer could never forget his great
attempt, one December &#8220;examination day,&#8221; to
obtain a physical description of it from Zebedee
Fuller.</p>

<p>Not, however, because his questions were not
fully and accurately answered, somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what shape is Skanigo Lake, Master Fuller?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Round, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Round?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; &#8217;round among the hills, &#8217;way up, as
far as it can go.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, yes. You do not altogether comprehend
my interrogatory. But what profundity does it
attain? How deep is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Varies very much, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. An admirable response. But when
is it deepest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In July, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;July?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. No depth at all in winter. Bottom
freezes hard and gets on top, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will put you in natural philosophy, next
term, Master Fuller. But what are the longitudinal
and lateral extent&mdash;the width and length,
I mean, of Skanigo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has none, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No length or width?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. Puff Evans told me he&#8217;d caught
everything there was in that lake. All his fault,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baptist and Presbyterian ministers came
to Dr. Dryer&#8217;s assistance at that point, for
they were both good fishermen, and Zebedee
escaped from the remaining geography of
Skanigo.</p>

<p>In that brief ten minutes, however, he had won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the lasting good-will of Euphemia Dryer and the
settled enmity of her stepmother.</p>

<p>On the morning after the bell and heifer mystery,
no sooner was breakfast over than Bar and
Val gathered together their fishing-gear, and
were off to make acquaintance with Skanigo for
themselves.</p>

<p>The walk was nothing at all, nor was it difficult
to find the way to the curiously constructed
dwelling of Puff Evans. The land thereabout
was the supposed heritage of a non-resident family
of &#8220;minor heirs,&#8221; and Puff had settled himself
in a little cove with no more trouble of mind
about his lack of title than a wild Indian or a
Western &#8220;squatter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did no manner of harm. In fact, he had
actually &#8220;improved&#8221; a few acres, managing to
have, as Zeb Fuller said: &#8220;The kindest-hearted,
best-natured crops in the world; the only potatoes
ever heard of that did their own hoeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between his scanty but &#8220;good-natured&#8221; acres
and the liberal bosom of Skanigo, however, Puff
succeeded in providing for the natural wants of
himself, his very congenial wife, and a swarm of
little Puffs, whose only need of clothing, as remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
by Zebedee, was to conceal their fins and
scales.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity Puff drinks,&#8221; said Zeb to Gershom Todderley
one day. &#8220;Sometime he&#8217;ll make a mistake
and bring in those young ones of his, all
cleaned, on a string with his other fish. And
there won&#8217;t one of &#8217;em suspect but what it&#8217;s all
right. Good pan-fish they&#8217;d make, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar and Val found Puff down by the waterside,
proudly contemplating the very neat proportions
and finish of his favorite property.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d ha&#8217; just broke my heart to ha&#8217; lost that
there boat,&#8221; he said, after exchanging a very enthusiastic
greeting with his young visitors.
&#8220;And now I&#8217;d a liked to ha&#8217; gone off with ye, but
I&#8217;ve made up my mind on somethin&#8217; else for to-day,
an&#8217; I don&#8217;t see how I kin change it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t change it on our account,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;Just tell us where to go, and we&#8217;ll take care of
ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would have taken the boys a good month to
have followed all the directions that Puff gave
them, for he hardly stopped talking until they were
out of ear-shot. Even then he stood knee-deep in
the water by the shore, gazing fondly after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
graceful little vessel, as if he half deemed it a
breach of faith that he was not on board of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way&#8217;d we better go, Val?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right up the lake, not far out,&#8221; said Val.
&#8220;Then we can drop anchor and fish for perch
while you walk into your Latin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>And all right it was, for the rowing was good
fun of itself, and it seemed as if there were new
things worth looking at to be seen with every
fresh pull at the oars.</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Val, at last. &#8220;Puff&#8217;s put
rope enough on this grapnel to anchor anywhere
in the lake. He&#8217;s fond of deep-water fishing.
Pulls up right big ones, sometimes&mdash;bass, pickerel,
and now and then a lake trout. He says the fish
are changing. Somebody put thousands and
thousands of young ones in a few years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rope? I should say he had,&#8221; remarked Bar.
&#8220;Did I tell you Mr. Brayton took the bell-rope
over to the Doctor&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; said Val. &#8220;Wonder if he&#8217;s any
idea who did all that, or how it was done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have now,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;That heifer came
in through one of the basement doors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Val; &#8220;but they were all
barred on the inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And opened from the inside to let her in.
Then it was easy to close &#8217;em all up behind her,
fix her horns in the bell-rope and get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did they get in or out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you that, too, when we set our own
trap for the bell,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I found out when
Mr. Brayton and I were going up into the belfry.
The rest of them haven&#8217;t guessed it, unless Mr.
Brayton himself has. If he did, he forgot to tell
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our trap?&#8221; asked Val. &#8220;Are we going to
set one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Val,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you hear all
they had to say yesterday, about our house being
haunted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and Mrs. Wood didn&#8217;t seem to more&#8217;n
half like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t help that, you know, but I
move we send all the ghosts over into the belfry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you do it?&#8221; asked Val, with a look of admiring
faith at his wonderful companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;We must take home with
us that extra length of anchor-rope. It&#8217;s small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and strong. Just the thing. Then we must get
some bits of wood and a yard or two of canvas,
and we can do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Puff Evans has a regular workshop down
by his house,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;He&#8217;s a kind of a
genius in his way, if he only knew what work
meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s fish, then,&#8221; exclaimed Bar, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
study hard. We shan&#8217;t have an hour to spare.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a curious piece of business, that Latin
grammar, lying flat on the seat in front of Bar
Vernon, as he sat in the stern of the boat, with his
quick eyes glancing from that to the float of his
fish-line.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the pages were turned pretty
fast, from time to time, and every now and then
a perch or a sunfish would come flopping in over
the side of the boat and be promptly transferred
to Puff Evans&#8217;s well-contrived &#8220;fish-car,&#8221; just aft
of the centre-board. Val, too, sitting at the prow,
was getting very fair luck, only that he would
lose some of his best bites in watching Bar and
wondering what might be the nature of the trap
that he was planning for the benefit of the ghosts
and the Academy bell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>&#8220;Do you understand what you&#8217;re reading?&#8221;
he asked, at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;It&#8217;s all I can
do to remember it. Mr. Brayton doesn&#8217;t expect
me to understand it at one reading. He told
me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose he expects you to remember
it, either,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good deal more than
I could do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;Once
I understand a thing I&#8217;m sure to forget it. Never
can repeat it in the same words again.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not very clear to Val&#8217;s comprehension,
even then, but Bar worked and fished away till
there came a long interval during which neither
of them had so much as a nibble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sun&#8217;s getting too high,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what Puff told us. No use to fish any more;
we&#8217;ve a tip-top string, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pull back, then,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
in all the Latin I can hold, for once. Perhaps
we can get Puff to help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he only knows it isn&#8217;t real work,&#8221; said
Val. &#8220;Tell him it&#8217;s play and he&#8217;ll work his head
off.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>The trouble with Puff Evans must have been
that he had grown up to be the father of a family
without in any manner ceasing to be a boy.
There are a good many grown-up people in the
same condition, and some of them were not very
remarkable boys, either.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the landing, the two friends
found Puff waiting for them. He had discerned
the return of his treasure at a greater distance
than any other man could have made her out,
and now he expressed his entire approval of the
morning&#8217;s catch, except that he mildly deprecated
the absence of anything like big fish.</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps they&#8217;ll bite better for you when they
come to know you,&#8221; he said encouragingly.
&#8220;They&#8217;re a little strange to your way of fishing
yet. Are ye goin&#8217; right back to th&#8217; village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;we&#8217;ve some fun on hand
we want to talk to you about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Puff was all ears in a moment, and the result
of Bar&#8217;s explanation was that the boys were
taken over to the workshop at once, while Mrs.
Evans began with intense zeal to broil some
fresh fish for their noonday meal.</p>

<p>It speedily came out that Puff had indeed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
sound reason for denying himself that day&#8217;s sport
on the water. The experience of the previous
day and the suggestions of Pat Murphy that
morning had borne quick fruit in the shape of a
commencement on another boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve named the old one <i>Mary</i>,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;arter my wife, and I reckon you may name this
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When it&#8217;s built,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a wonder
you never thought of it before. You can
make money at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps,&#8221; said Puff, drily, &#8220;but I&#8217;d no idea I&#8217;d
inj&#8217;ye it so much as I hev. Might ha&#8217; known it,
too. I was jest as happy a-buildin&#8217; the <i>Mary</i>.
When a man finds a piece of real work in
which he can be just happy, that&#8217;s the kind of
thing God meant him for most likely, and he&#8217;d
better go ahead and do it, if he can do it
honestly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bar and Val were too full of their own
ideas to linger very long in looking at Puff&#8217;s
boat, and Bar found his ideas caught up and
put into shape with a readiness of perception
and a swiftness of execution which altogether surprised
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make a perfect job of it,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;What do you think it will be worth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worth?&#8221; inquired Puff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;What are we to pay you
for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Puff, with a darkening brow,
&#8220;didn&#8217;t you tell me it was a big joke on Ogleport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; began Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;And ain&#8217;t I to hev any sheer o&#8217; the fun?&#8221;
asked Puff. &#8220;Besides, I&#8217;m on hand for anything
you two fellers are up to. I owe ye all
the good turns in the world. Jest don&#8217;t you
say anythin&#8217; more about pay, or you&#8217;ll spile it
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t, then,&#8221; said Bar, for it was easy
to see that Puff was beginning to feel hurt;
and at that moment Mrs. Evans appeared at
the door of the shop to tell them dinner was
ready.</p>

<p>So were the boys, for fishing and rowing on
Skanigo were fine things for young appetites,
and before that meal was over, it became clear
that some more fish would have to be caught
if they meant to carry anything like a respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
string home with them. They did that,
however, and they carried something else more
than halfway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>MAJOR MONTAGUE&#8217;S PLANS THWARTED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> very nearly the hour when Bar Vernon and
Val Manning set out for that day&#8217;s fishing on
Skanigo, a big, well-dressed man was standing
in the front door of an &#8220;east side&#8221; hotel in the
great city, absorbed, apparently, in some deep
and gloomy train of thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a trace of him,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Oh,
what a fool I was to let him go! He never
seemed half so valuable before. And then, those
papers! Blessings brighten as they take their
flight. Gone, completely gone, after keeping my
hold on him and them so long. That&#8217;s what
comes of getting too drunk. A fit of pity is sure
to follow. Always so with me. Now, as far as
I can see, my best hold is on these swells that
have taken him in tow. No use trying to bully
men like them. They&#8217;d only laugh at me. Only
show is to sell out to &#8217;em. They&#8217;d work it out
better&#8217;n I could, anyway, seeing I&#8217;m debarred so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
many privileges; but they shan&#8217;t do it without
letting me in for my share. I feel safe about
Bar. He&#8217;ll never open that thing till the time
comes. Queer fellow &#8217;bout some things. Anyhow,
I must make my trade before then. I&#8217;ll go
right down to old Danvers&#8217;s office this very
morning and set the wires a-working. Make hay
while the sun shines.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very important decision was that of Major
Montague, and it might have had an immediate
effect upon the tenor of Bar Vernon&#8217;s &#8220;new time,&#8221;
if he had been permitted to carry it into effect.</p>

<p>Alas for the Major and his plans, however, that
sunny morning!</p>

<p>On an opposite corner of the street, at that
very moment, a tall, foreign-looking gentleman
was leaning over and talking low to a short,
broad, keen-eyed man, as he pointed in the direction
of the Major.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the chap. You might as well spot him
now. May not have another chance. Of course
it wouldn&#8217;t do to have him convicted. He&#8217;d
squeal too loud. But he must be put out of the
way for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Free board at a public institution for six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
months,&#8221; returned the short man. &#8220;Will that
do, Prosper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That or thereabouts,&#8221; replied Prosper; &#8220;but
he mustn&#8217;t see me. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Prosper drew back and disappeared around
the corner; but, in another minute, a hand was
laid lightly on Major Montague&#8217;s arm, and an
oddly deferential voice said to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Major, you&#8217;re wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pale indeed grew the rosy face of the Major,
for he seemed to need no second look to establish
the identity of the new arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come up to my room with me and
let me get my things?&#8221; he asked, huskily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not just now, thank you,&#8221; replied the short
man, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll send for them and have them
brought down to your new hotel for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paler still grew the Major&#8217;s face, but, although
half as large again as the short, broad
man, he walked silently and unresistingly away
with him.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Oh, nothing. Only that other man, though
none of the best, so far as he himself was concerned,
had walked up to Major Montague in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
character of <i>the law</i>, and the hand so lightly laid
upon the Major&#8217;s arm had been that of <i>power</i>,
and all such men as he wilt like dying plants
when they are brought into contact with those
two things.</p>

<p>Honesty greets the law as a brother, and
charity shakes hands with power. Major Montague&#8217;s
hand was shaking, indeed, but not in that
way. Before Bar Vernon sat down to his broiled
perch at Puff Evans&#8217;s table, his far-away uncle
had been provided with quarters in a &#8220;new
hotel&#8221; that was very old and musty, but from
which he would make no calls on Judge Danvers
until the Law should say to Power that &#8220;bail&#8221;
had been found, or that other reasons required
a further change of boarding-place for the Major.</p>

<p>A strange &#8220;hotel&#8221; was that, with such strong
doors and locks, and such carefully guarded windows.
Perfectly &#8220;burglar-proof,&#8221; one would be
inclined to think, and yet more burglars and
other thieves got into it in the course of a year
than into all the other hotels in the great city
put together. Only some of them had too
little difficulty in getting in and too much in
getting out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>Neither Bar Vernon nor any of his friends
knew what had become of Major Montague, and
perhaps none of them would have cared to ask,
unless reminded of him in some way.</p>

<p>Bar himself was too crammed full of the
thoughts and things of his &#8220;new time&#8221; to dwell
much just now upon the old or its individual
characters.</p>

<p>When he and Val reached home that evening
they found that Mrs. Wood had kindly kept a
good supper and a mild scolding ready for them,
and that George Brayton was also waiting till
they should get through with both and come
up-stairs.</p>

<p>They made a fair report of their operations on
the lake, but did not seem to think the assistant
principal of the Academy would be interested
in their new mechanical contrivances. At all
events, they did not say a word to him about the
&#8220;trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>He on his part listened to all that they had to tell
with a degree of kindly sympathy which would
have won for him the unmeasured contempt of
Mrs. Dryer; but the main point of his curiosity,
after all, was as to how much Latin had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
been captured in the intervals between the
&#8220;bites.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, however, Brayton was destined to be altogether
surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I hear you recite?&#8221; he said to Bar. &#8220;I
can ask you questions as we go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar handed him the grammar, open at the
title page, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where I began,&#8221; and immediately
launched out into a repetition of every word
on it.</p>

<p>Brayton listened with an amused and curious
air, and turned the leaf as Bar reached the &#8220;date
of publication&#8221; at the bottom.</p>

<p>Next came the preface, and then the introduction,
and Bar waded rapidly but almost
unerringly through them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;Have you gone
any farther?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About half a mile, I should say,&#8221; replied Bar,
with the first sign of a smile he had given.
&#8220;You told me to begin at the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I should say you had,&#8221; said Brayton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
&#8220;It will take you long enough to digest all
that. To-morrow you may take up your Greek,
and I&#8217;ll try to make up my own mind how
on earth I&#8217;d better go to work with yours.
You&#8217;ve a good one. The only question is what
to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a good many things with it already,
but most of them don&#8217;t suit me very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about it hereafter,&#8221; said Brayton,
thoughtfully. &#8220;You and Mr. Manning may go
now. I think you have done a good day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they had, but George Brayton had no notion
of what the best part of it&mdash;the hardest, at all
events&mdash;consisted. Neither had it yet been
completed, and the boys retired to their own
room to give the matter due consideration.</p>

<p>A large, pleasant room it was, at the rear of
the house, and one of its windows opened upon
the sloping roof of the one-story back-building
which old Judge Wood, in his pride, had deemed
necessary to complete the proportions of his
mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have foreseen our necessities,&#8221; remarked
Bar. &#8220;You know, Val, it won&#8217;t do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
anybody to see us go out or come in. Now there
isn&#8217;t a tree anywhere else within four rods of the
house, but that old maple yonder leans clean over
the back roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy enough to get into that and slide down,&#8221;
said Val. &#8220;I guess other boys that have boarded
with Mrs. Wood must have done it many a time.
I never had this room before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start about ten o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a pretty dark night. Stars,
but no moon till very late. That&#8217;s just what we
want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moonshine enough last night,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Bar, &#8220;wasn&#8217;t it about midnight?
That&#8217;ll be just when we want it. Now
we must do some studying, or I must, and then
we&#8217;ll go to bed for awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val hardly knew what to make of a fellow who
could pick up a Latin grammar and go to work
so doggedly under such circumstances.</p>

<p>He could not have done it, to save his life, but
he managed to get fairly interested in &#8220;Ivanhoe&#8221;
while Bar was studying.</p>

<p>Neither of the city boys had given a moment&#8217;s
thought that day, as to the notions formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
them by the young gentlemen of the village,
important as they were likely to find that very
thing.</p>

<p>They might, indeed, have been surprised if
they had known how very thoroughly they had
been discussed, or how largely their arrival entered
into the current plans and calculations of
Zebedee Fuller and his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Zeb,&#8221; said Hy Allen, as they sat on the
log by the mill-dam after taking their accustomed
swim, &#8220;we all know Val Manning well enough,
and he wasn&#8217;t so very hard to manage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young aristocrat,&#8221; growled Zeb. &#8220;Thinks
he&#8217;s a mile and a half above us Ogleport boys.
And this new chap that&#8217;s come along with him,
he&#8217;s ten times worse than Val. They&#8217;re boarding
at Ma&#8217;am Wood&#8217;s, you know, and so&#8217;s Brayton.
He&#8217;ll take &#8217;em right in charge, and they&#8217;ll
get in on everything ahead of us. Tell you
what, boys, those fellows have got to have a
setting down. Here they&#8217;ve bought the best
boat on all Skanigo first day they got here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps, if the truth were told, Zeb&#8217;s jealousy
was very much less on account of the boat, or
good clothes, or even &#8220;citified ways,&#8221; after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
than because the objects of his dislikes were
domiciled with George Brayton.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, Zeb had acquired a feeling
of &#8220;ownership&#8221; for the new teacher, and was
very much disposed to resent what looked like an
invasion of his vested rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only two of &#8217;em,&#8221; vaguely suggested
Bill Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know how many are coming,&#8221; replied
Zeb. &#8220;I move we take proper measures for
the subjugation of these two before the rest get
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in for that!&#8221; exclaimed Hy Allen, whose
somewhat pugnacious cast of features indicated
very faithfully the character of their owner.</p>

<p>Hy was half a head taller than Zeb Fuller,
and decidedly his superior, physically, only such
a thing as a quarrel, or even a test of strength
with his &#8220;chieftain&#8221; had probably never occurred
to him.</p>

<p>The subject of the &#8220;new boys&#8221; had been
coming up again and again all day, and had gone
far towards neutralizing the happiness which the
bell and heifer mystery might otherwise have
supplied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>It was now, however, becoming threadbare and
distasteful, for the time, and the council at the
mill-dam slowly broke up and dispersed, even Zeb
Fuller&#8217;s nearest friends finding some other errand,
so that he was all alone when he met the
Rev. Dr. Dryer as he walked up the street towards
his father&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if the indelicate conduct of the dun
heifer weighed on his spirits,&#8221; soliloquized Zeb.
&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll not give Solomon an excuse for saying
I avoid him. Good-evening, Dr. Dryer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb&#8217;s face had nearly recovered from the effects
of his combat with the Rodney vagabonds,
but it was not at any time specially adapted to
the look of dignified benevolence he now tried to
make it assume.</p>

<p>Dr. Dryer, at sight of Zeb Fuller, had been
taken possession of by one idea, however, and he
failed to appreciate the effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee,&#8221; he exclaimed, with deep solemnity
of manner, &#8220;how did that cow get into the
Academy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a single long word,&#8221; thought Zeb, &#8220;and
that&#8217;s bad for Solomon.&#8221; He, however, answered
promptly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>&#8220;Dr. Dryer, that matter troubles me. There&#8217;s
something supernatural about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Supernatural?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghostly!&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;This village is going
to the bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee!&#8221; exclaimed the Doctor. &#8220;Are you
so lost as that? Do you believe in ghosts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Firmly,&#8221; responded Zeb. &#8220;Ogleport is getting
full of them. I don&#8217;t know what we shall
do when Mrs. Wood&#8217;s lot get back again for the
winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see your father about this,&#8221; said the
Doctor, with an ominous wag of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do, please,&#8221; replied Zeb; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what&#8217;s to become of Mr. Brayton, who seems a
deserving young man, or those poor boys from
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Doctor gazed very hard at Zeb through his
spectacles, and half wished that he had his wife
with him; but the youth said something about his
own cows to the effect that he hoped the ghosts
would let them alone, and marched steadily
away up the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remarkable!&#8221; exclaimed the Doctor. &#8220;Superstition
assailing the uneducated intellect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
even this favored generation. This must be
looked to. I wonder what Mrs. Dryer will say
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He wondered less an hour or so later, when he
consulted his beloved Dorothy Jane in the presence
of Euphemia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Zeb to the deacon, when he came
back from the cow pasture, &#8220;if old Sol comes to
consult you about supernatural noises and appearances
at the Academy, I wish you would
humor him a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee, what&#8217;s up now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard to tell,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;Old Sol seems unable
to comprehend how that bell managed to
rope in his dun heifer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; replied the deacon, with a
very sharp look at his heir; but he and Mrs.
Fuller had been talking the matter over, and
had decided not to press Zeb too closely about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing all I can for this village,&#8221; said Zeb
to himself, that night, &#8220;but I fear an increase of
activity will shortly be demanded.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A NOCTURNAL ESCAPADE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of Ogleport was satisfactorily
quiet, and as dark as the occasion called for,
when Bar Vernon and Val Manning, with their
shoes fastened to their waistbands, crept noiselessly
out on the back roof.</p>

<p>There was not the least difficulty in getting
into the branches of the maple, or from them to
the ground below.</p>

<p>Then the shoes were hurriedly put on, and the
two boys were off through the garden, down to
the river bank, and from thence it was easy
enough to gain one of the lower crossroads
without being seen.</p>

<p>Half a mile of brisk walking in the direction
of the lake brought them to the clump of bushes
where they had hidden the joint product of their
own skill and that of Puff Evans.</p>

<p>A curious thing it was.</p>

<p>A sort of &#8220;van&#8221; or wing about three feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
square, made of a wooden frame with cotton
cloth stretched across it, and one side of the
frame swung easily in a pair of &#8220;journal holes&#8221;
bored in another and stronger frame.</p>

<p>Below the wing, at right angles to the outside
frame, a sort of arm reached down about two
inches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you&#8217;ll make it work,&#8221; said
Val, &#8220;but I suppose you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show you when we get there,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;Now we must make for the sheds.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time the two boys reached the rear of
the Academy there was not a soul stirring in all
Ogleport.</p>

<p>Even Dr. Dryer felt safe about the bell, now that
the rope had been removed, and he had looked
to the doors and windows for himself, that afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a good climber, Val?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll let you in through that side-door in
the basement,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;You keep the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how&#8217;ll you get in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lightning-rod,&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;It goes up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
close by one of the second story windows, and
that has no fastening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it strong enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty. That&#8217;s the way the village boys got
in. One of &#8217;em left the mark of his heel deep in
the grass at the bottom. Must have slipped and
come down hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a detective!&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>It would have done the heart of Zeb Fuller
good, if it had not revolutionized his views concerning
&#8220;those two boarders,&#8221; if he had seen the
practiced skill and agility with which Bar Vernon
went up that lightning-rod.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s equal to his billiards,&#8221; thought Val.</p>

<p>Yes, and it had been learned very much in the
same way, during some of the queer episodes of
his &#8220;old time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The window was opened and Bar disappeared,
shutting it carefully and silently behind him,
while Val hurried around to the basement door.</p>

<p>That, too, was speedily unbarred, and Val and
his machine admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you barring it behind us for?&#8221;
asked Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want any accidents,&#8221; Bar began, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
then he added, &#8220;Hush, we&#8217;re not inside here a
minute too soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed they were not, for one of the Academy
trustees, unable to be easy in his mind over the
events of the previous night, had come out for a
scouting expedition of his own.</p>

<p>Slowly, with heavy and circumspect tread, the
good citizen was making his rounds of the old
edifice, and now he carefully tried the fastenings
of that lower door and peered anxiously
in through the curtainless windows.</p>

<p>Very still kept the two adventurers, and
both felt an unusually active pumping at their
hearts, until they were sure that every door and
window within his reach had been examined by
the careful trustee, and that he had taken his
satisfied departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Val,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;we&#8217;re safe enough.
Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up they went, first into the main hall, then
into the second story, then up the creaking and
short-turning flight of steps which led to the
lower deck of the steeple bell-tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;This west window,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;towards the
roof, is just the thing for our windmill. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
wind has a clean sweep across the deck, for there
isn&#8217;t a bit of sash all around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There used to be, in winter,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;but
I s&#8217;pose they think this deck is roof enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; said Bar, as he worked steadily and
rapidly away, &#8220;but nobody can see this west
window from the ground, unless they get over
into the graveyard back of the sheds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it quite yet,&#8221; said Val.
&#8220;Even if the wind works it, how&#8217;ll it ring the
bell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; replied Bar, &#8220;up there, on one side of
the bell, is an old pulley-wheel. I&#8217;ll have to oil
it before it will run well. Now, I&#8217;ll hitch the
end of this rope to the bell-hammer, and pass it
over that wheel. It&#8217;ll come down at the east
side, close to the timbers, where nobody can see
it with a telescope. Then I&#8217;ll pass it under this
wheel here and hitch it to the lower arm of our
van. Then, if there comes a good wind, that
bell&#8217;s bound to toll every time the van is blown
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take a west wind for it,&#8221; said
Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, to work it regularly,&#8221; replied Bar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
&#8220;but &#8217;most any wind may do some good. Now,
I&#8217;ve a pokerish job before me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked like it, indeed!</p>

<p>Val Manning was brave enough, but he would
hardly have liked to undertake that climb in the
dark. Not every boy would have cared for it in
broad daylight.</p>

<p>Up went Bar, however, as surely and as rapidly
as if he had served an apprenticeship at sea, and
Val waited for him in almost breathless expectation
till he saw him once more emerge into the
moonlight, which was now beginning to stream
through the bell-tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll work,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but I came pretty near
losing my hold once. That would have been a
bad piece of business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed you!&#8221; exclaimed Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I fell as far as that
once, but I came down on my feet. Made me
lame for a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val made up his mind that he would know more
about his chum&#8217;s adventures some day, but just
now there was too much work on hand for any
further talking.</p>

<p>Bar&#8217;s mechanical genius had not been altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
neglected, although he did not know anything
of &#8220;book&#8221; mathematics, and in half an
hour more he was able to show Val how that
van would be sure to make a good pull on the
rope if the wind would only do its share of the
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad there&#8217;s none blowing now,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be, before long,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;there
was a halo round the moon last night. Now we
must manage to get back to bed again without
being seen. Nobody&#8217;ll suspect new boys like us,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But won&#8217;t they be after poor Zeb Fuller!&#8221;
exclaimed Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get acquainted with that fellow,&#8221; replied
Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll take care of that,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;They&#8217;re
going to play ball on the green to-morrow, and
we can take a look at him then. Only we&#8217;re sure
to get into some kind of a muss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better, then,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t settle matters with a crowd like his a day
too soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better go home around by the river,
anyhow,&#8221; said Val.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>The process of getting out of the building was
a good deal like that of getting in, for Bar would
not listen to Val&#8217;s proposition to slide down the
lightning-rod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not,&#8221; he said, &#8220;till you&#8217;ve had some sort of
practice first. It isn&#8217;t so safe and easy as it
looks, and you mustn&#8217;t run any unnecessary risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t any kind of risk for me,&#8221; replied
Bar, &#8220;so long as the rod&#8217;s strong enough to hold
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more on solid ground, outside the building,
Bar insisted on the greatest watchfulness and
caution in working their way around and back to
the bank of the little river. There, at least, they
fancied themselves safe, and were pushing along
from one lot to another, for the fences were no
sort of obstacle, although they were built close
down to the water.</p>

<p>As they sprang over into one inclosure, however,
they were greeted by a hoarse, deep, threatening
growl, which brought them to an immediate
stand, and there before them, in the moonlight,
they discerned the forms of a well-grown
boy and a dog who was only too &#8220;well-grown.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s Zeb Fuller and his Bob,&#8221; exclaimed Val.
&#8220;We&#8217;re in his father&#8217;s lot. Zebedee,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;what are you doing out here at this time of
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Set some night-lines for eels,&#8221; said Zebedee,
&#8220;and my mind was troubled about them. But
what are you out for? Don&#8217;t you see what an
awful example you&#8217;re setting Bob and me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; said Val. &#8220;Oh, we are taking a look
at the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;I must go and talk with
Solomon about it to-morrow. Have you tried
your new boat yet, Mr. Cash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vernon,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;Bar Vernon. He&#8217;s to
be my chum this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had a good time in her to-day,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;Good boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Zebedee, &#8220;and it was Puff
Evans&#8217;s bad luck that the cow tolled the bell for
last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;don&#8217;t you and the cow worry
about Puff Evans. He&#8217;s satisfied. If you don&#8217;t
believe it you can ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask him,&#8221; said Zeb, with more surliness
than usually belonged to his nature, but he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
not like the looks of things at all. Just then,
however, the line he was pulling in gave unmistakable
tokens of having something on it, and
the next moment he had not only one eel, but two
of them, and large ones, wriggling on the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes six for to-night,&#8221; he remarked, as
Bob furtively tried one of the slimy prizes with
his paw. &#8220;Fond of eels, Cash?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;I owned an eel-mill once.
Show you how to make one, sometime. Come
on, Val. That&#8217;s a very dissipated-looking dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they were talking, Bar and Val had
quietly walked along till they were halfway
across the lot, and Bob had apparently recognized
them as &#8220;boys,&#8221; for whom, as such, all fences
and the like were constitutionally free, for he had
not repeated his note of warning.</p>

<p>Even Zeb Fuller was for once a little taken
aback.</p>

<p>He had his own reasons for not wishing to
make a disturbance at that place and time, but he
gazed half-angrily after the two friends as they
vaulted over into the next inclosure.</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<p>&#8220;Dissipated? Bob, was there ever impudence
like that? These fellows&#8217;ll get more instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
than old Sol can give them before
they&#8217;re many days older. Robert, my boy, did
you hear what they said about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was pawing the eels with a very discontented
sort of whine, and did not take up the
insult with any spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;They said you had a dissipated look, Robert.
Well, so you have, and I mustn&#8217;t keep you out
so late o&#8217; nights any more. But won&#8217;t I get
even with that pair before I&#8217;m done with &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb Fuller had very plainly had his own way
too much in Ogleport, and his rustic narrowness
had got him into a very bad state of mind. In
fact, he and his friends had too much accustomed
themselves, in a thoroughly Saxonish way, to
regard the entire race of Academy &#8220;boarders&#8221;
as a very undesirable lot of &#8220;foreigners,&#8221; if not,
also, as a kind of &#8220;invaders,&#8221; to whom small
mercy belonged on the part of himself and the
other &#8220;natives.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE BOXING MATCH</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rest of that night was reasonably calm,
and Bar and Val slept soundly, without any
fear of trouble in the belfry, nor did they fail
to promptly answer the bell for breakfast.</p>

<p>After that, a trip to the lake, a look at Puff
Evans and his workshop, and a few hours of
fishing, followed, as a matter of course, only Bar
Vernon discovered that he was not going to go
through the Greek grammar &#8220;across lots,&#8221; as he
had begun to do with the Latin.</p>

<p>They found Puff rapidly becoming absorbed
and enthusiastic about his new boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hev to go over to old Todderley&#8217;s after
some more lumber to-morrow,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
&#8217;pears like I can&#8217;t bear to leave it for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there some danger that old Skinner
might get wind of it and try to take it away
from you?&#8221; suggested Bar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>The boat-builder blew out his flabby cheeks
with a most mournful puff, and the saw he was
using dropped from his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, what on &#8217;arth <i>is</i> the use?&#8221; he exclaimed,
as if all the beauty and glory had
suddenly been knocked out of his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of that last night,&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll write out a bill of sale for the boat, when I
get home. Call it mine till it&#8217;s sold. I&#8217;ll swap
you the <i>Mary</i> for it, now, if you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that there a leetle crooked?&#8221; slowly
responded Puff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a little,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;He means to steal
the boat and we mean to hide it, that&#8217;s all. Send
him to me if he troubles you and I&#8217;ll fix him.
You needn&#8217;t be afraid, though. He won&#8217;t dream
of coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind doing that,&#8221; said Puff.
&#8220;Reckon I kin go to work agin now. Hope
you&#8217;ll have a right good day&#8217;s fishin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they did, so far as it went, but the boys
had made up their minds to be on the green in
time to take a look at the game of baseball as
well as at the boys who came to play it.</p>

<p>On their return home they found that George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
Brayton had gone for an afternoon drive, and
that Mrs. Wood was inclined to scold a little at
their being so late for their dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind her, Bar,&#8221; said Val, when she
was out of hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll kill some of her
ghosts for her if she isn&#8217;t good to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clearing up a little,&#8221; replied Val. &#8220;The
ghosts may be heard from sooner than people
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time the boys came out again the usually
deserted green began to put on a somewhat lively
appearance.</p>

<p>The two friends had hardly supposed Ogleport
could turn out so many &#8220;young men&#8221; of all
ages, from twenty years down, and Val declared
that several of the older ones were &#8220;boarders,&#8221;
like themselves, while others had come in from
the surrounding farms and were there by accident.</p>

<p>Bar noticed, however, that the one &#8220;pervading
spirit,&#8221; busiest and most controlling, but without
being either talkative or meddlesome, was that
odd chap, Zeb Fuller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has something on his mind to-day, or I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
mistaken,&#8221; he remarked to Val. &#8220;I never saw
just such another. Was he the fellow that
thrashed you last term?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Val; &#8220;he once and that big fellow
there another time. That&#8217;s Hy Allen, and
he&#8217;s a sort of bully of the Academy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Val, my boy,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
those two have made up their minds to try it
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had we better keep away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no manner of means,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;only
you must promise me one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me give &#8217;em their first lesson, if they&#8217;re
bound to have one. You&#8217;re enough for either of
them, now, I think, but I want to take the conceit
out of them in a way of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;all right; only I don&#8217;t
mean to be counted out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the two friends were strolling,
as they had a perfect right, to the spot
where the preliminaries of the game were being
arranged, when they were suddenly greeted
with these words from Hy Allen:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>&#8220;Hullo! you fellows, are you going to
play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not this time,&#8221; said Bar, quietly; &#8220;we prefer
to look on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You prefer to look on?&#8221; very mockingly
responded Zeb Fuller himself, for there was a
good deal in Bar Vernon&#8217;s manner that he had
made up his mind not to like. &#8220;If you&#8217;re above
playing ball with us, what are you here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;you may play. We don&#8217;t
want the green for anything to-day. Go on
with your game.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were enough boys among the bystanders
who were glad to hear Zeb Fuller answered in his
own peculiar way, and the laugh that followed
was not a feeble one.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may play, may we?&#8221; began Zeb, but
just then a peculiarly mocking and jeering laugh
sounded in his very ears, and he wheeled around
with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hy Allen!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Hiram was also seeking for the source
of a very similar insult, and it seemed to Bill
Jones as if some one behind him asked him for
his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>&#8220;Play football, you know,&#8221; added the insulting
stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, boys,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;this looks like a
conspiracy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a ghost,&#8221; seemed to come from the open
mouth of Hiram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Hy,&#8221; said Zeb; &#8220;all the
ghosts are at Mrs. Wood&#8217;s. Have you seen
any?&#8221; he asked, turning again to the chums.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw one last night,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;down by the
river, catching eels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, you fellows,&#8221; again began Hy
Allen, when the derisive laugh once more interrupted
him. It was not a loud one, but it was
extremely tantalizing, and the Academy &#8220;bully&#8221;
looked angrily but vainly around for the source
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go on with your game?&#8221;
asked Bar. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear me say you
might? Even if you don&#8217;t know how, you&#8217;re
old enough to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Exasperatingly polite was Bar. Zeb Fuller
himself, at his very best, could not have been
more so, and again there was a laugh at Zeb&#8217;s
expense from among the outsiders. Zeb was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
altogether too popular with his own set, and they
had carried things with too high a hand not to
have stirred up jealousies against them. As for
Hy Allen, there were a dozen of boys, at least,
on that green who had felt the weight of his
hand at one time or another. It was evident to
all the onlookers, as far as appearances went,
that neither Bar nor Val had the shadow of a
chance in any physical encounter with Hy, and
not much more with Zeb Fuller or Bill Jones,
but all the more for that there was a strong
feeling of admiration for the cool self-possession
of the two strangers. Even their somewhat
fashionable, citified dress was halfway
forgiven them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Game!&#8221; exclaimed Hy Allen, as angry as if
he had received some genuine injury. &#8220;This is
our green. I&#8217;ll teach you a game, one you won&#8217;t
forget right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em a chance, Hy,&#8221; exclaimed Zeb
Fuller. &#8220;You two, Val Manning and Cash&mdash;Bar
whatever your name is&mdash;go home now and
keep your clothes clean. Tell him what a licking
you got last time, Val.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;and he liked it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
well, I thought I&#8217;d come over and get one
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the mocking laugh chuckled in Hy
Allen&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>Bar Vernon was scarcely six paces distant
now, with that polite, deferential smile of his,
and as Hiram turned again to get a look at his
tormentor, Zeb Fuller&#8217;s long bottled-up temper
got the better, or the worse, of him, and made a
sudden rush, as if to grapple with Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him, Val!&#8221; shouted Bar, and Val was
almost as much surprised as Zeb himself to find
that young genius whirled backward into his
arms, so that he had only to pin him and hurl
him flat upon the grass.</p>

<p>Hy Allen had followed his friend almost instantly,
and so had Bill Jones, and the &#8220;rush&#8221; of
the former might have had danger in it, he was
so big and strong, but he seemed to catch his
foot in something, as Bar dodged under his arm,
and the next thing he knew, as he lay prone on
the grass, Bill Jones came tumbling over him
with a very unpleasant-looking nose.</p>

<p>The first impulse of the other boys of Zeb
Fuller&#8217;s set had been to &#8220;follow their leader,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
but not one of them had the remotest conception
of such a thing as the art of boxing, and four or
five of them, one after another, went down like
so many nine-pins.</p>

<p>It really seemed as if Bar Vernon had hardly
made an effort, until, as Hy Allen struggled to
his feet, there was a sudden bound forward, a
cracking &#8220;spat&#8221; as if something hard hit something
else pretty hard, and the redoubtable
Hiram was down again.</p>

<p>Poor Zeb, too, had just such another experience
with his own antagonist, and it is
greatly to be feared that Val Manning made
things about even for that &#8220;last term&#8217;s licking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll all be perfectly safe,&#8221; remarked Bar,
&#8220;if you&#8217;ll only lie still when you&#8217;re down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? What does all this mean?&#8221;
suddenly exclaimed an excited voice behind him,
and Bar turned to find himself in no less a
presence than that of the Rev. Dr. Solomon
Dryer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean, sir?&#8221; again demanded
the Doctor, and Zebedee Fuller remarked to
himself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>&#8220;Not a single long word! That looks very
bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bar Vernon calmly and politely touched
his hat, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lessons in boxing, Dr. Dryer. Are they
contrary to the rules of the Academy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a trump, anyway!&#8221; said Zeb to himself.
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have beat that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boxing lessons?&#8221; said the Doctor, incredulously.
&#8220;What are those boys doing on
the grass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, boys,&#8221; shouted Bar.</p>

<p>Several were already so doing, but Hy Allen
was the last to resume his perpendicular, for his
blow and fall had been of an unusually heavy
kind.</p>

<p>Never in all his life, however, had Zeb Fuller
learned so much in so short a time, and never
did he &#8220;come to the front&#8221; so very ably.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us knew anything about boxing,
Dr. Dryer,&#8221; he said, very gravely. &#8220;If I&#8217;d have
had such a lesson a few weeks ago, I&#8217;d never have
had so hard a time with those Rodney fellows
that stole your cows. I hope sincerely you
won&#8217;t think of forbidding it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>Poor Bill Jones was wiping his bloody nose at
the moment, and the Doctor exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not observe that cruel and disgusting
spectacle? You, sir; what&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vernon, sir. Barnaby Vernon,&#8221; responded
our hero. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry I had no gloves on,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vernon? Ah, indeed. I see now. Mr.
Manning, is that you? I am astonished beyond
measure! And this is the young gentleman,
your father&#8217;s ward, concerning whom he sent me
a written communication. I will see you both
again about this business. In the meantime let
us have no more boxing lessons. I felt almost
sure you were all fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fighting! Indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Zebedee Fuller.
&#8220;Why, Doctor, do you suppose all Ogleport
would assail, with one accord, two innocent and
unoffending strangers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee,&#8221; replied the Doctor, &#8220;I should be
rather inclined to the opinion that the two unoffending
strangers had been administering
wholesome admonition to a part, at least, of
the population of Ogleport.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that, the Doctor turned upon his heel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and strode away, but Zebedee walked up to Bar
Vernon and held out his hand, remarking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Solomon is right, for once. If ever a man
like him can acquire wisdom, I should be ashamed
of myself to exhibit a lower order of intelligence.
I have no longer the least disposition to give you
a thrashing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I either,&#8221; said Bill Jones.</p>

<p>Hy Allen was a little slower, but in a moment
more he came in with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeb, ask him how he does it. I own up. It
beats me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the other boys, none of them had
suffered more than a sharp and sudden upset,
with a &#8220;contusion&#8221; or so, as a surgeon would
have described it, and they were quite willing
to join their comrades in calling it a drawn
battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is,&#8221; explained Zeb Fuller, &#8220;our side&#8217;s
drawn out. And now I hope we&#8217;ll be able to
make it all right with old Sol. Mr. Vernon, it
would delight me exceedingly if you would persuade
Solomon to let you give him a boxing
lesson and allow me to be personally present as
spectator.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>GEORGE BRAYTON&#8217;S DRIVE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">George Brayton</span> had been guilty of the
most natural thing in the world that afternoon.
He had spent the whole morning among his
books, retorts, air-pumps, and other matters, over
at the Academy building, and he desired something
else for a change.</p>

<p>That was his first visit to Ogleport, but,
although well aware that there was plenty of
fine scenery in the neighborhood, he had thus far
made no further acquaintance with it than he
had gained from the stage, as he was pulled
through the clouds of dust on the north road the
day of his arrival.</p>

<p>The young &#8220;assistant&#8221; had therefore deliberately
planned a sort of tour of investigation behind
a fast horse, and he meant to have a good
many more of the sort. In fact, he had entered
into a commercial treaty with the one livery
stable of Ogleport, down at Runner&#8217;s Tavern, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
supply him from time to time with all the fast
horses that he might need.</p>

<p>So far, so good, but how can a young man
enjoy fine scenery with no companion but a
horse?</p>

<p>Not very well, indeed, and, besides all that,
there was nothing selfish about George Brayton,
and he had instantly determined to share his first
drive with merry Effie Dryer.</p>

<p>He forgot, truly, to ask Effie&#8217;s stepmother for
her permission, and had impudently driven up to
the Doctor&#8217;s house after dinner, and proposed to
wait until Miss Euphemia should complete any
necessary preliminaries.</p>

<p>And Euphemia?</p>

<p>Dear little soul! She never once thought of
refusing, nor did she waste any great amount of
time over her simple toilet, but was ready with
a promptness which went to George&#8217;s very heart,
as anything so rare as that is quite likely to.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Dryer sat with Brayton in the
parlor, during those few minutes, and smiled on
him in a way that showed to perfection the artwork
of her dentist, but which did not disclose
an atom of the gall and wormwood with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
her heart had been stirred up when she saw him
hitch his horse in front of the gate.</p>

<p>It is barely possible that Effie knew more about it
than Brayton, or why should she have man&oelig;uvred
with such graceful swiftness and such entire success
to get into the parlor first?</p>

<p>By the time Mrs. Dryer came, also, Effie had
accepted the invitation to drive and &#8220;gone for
her things,&#8221; although, as the former smilingly
explained to George, &#8220;the Dorcas Society was to
meet that afternoon, and Euphemia would be very
much missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he had calmly replied,</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think likely she might. I never
saw a young lady who seemed to be more of a
general favorite. She&#8217;s a kind of sunbeam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How poetical you are!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Dryer. &#8220;I see you have one of Mr. Runner&#8217;s
horses. A bad sort of a man, they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good judge of horses, though,&#8221; replied
George. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity so many good men don&#8217;t
seem to know what a horse is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Mrs. Dryer, &#8220;but there&#8217;s
always seemed to me to be a great deal of wickedness
about horses.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>&#8220;There she comes,&#8221; was Brayton&#8217;s next remark,
and it referred to the rustle of Effie&#8217;s dress
on the stairs, not to any preposterous action on
the part of Runner&#8217;s fast mare at the gate.</p>

<p>Now it happened that George Brayton had
been a lover of horses from his youth up, and
many a pleasant hour and mile he had passed
behind his four-footed favorites, but his memory
failed to bring him up the ghost of a more enjoyable
drive than he took that afternoon.</p>

<p>Such a guide was Effie Dryer!</p>

<p>She knew just where to go, and her &#8220;driver&#8221;
turned into highways and byways, most submissively,
at her slightest bidding.</p>

<p>What surprised George most of all, however,
was to find how very much of womanly common
sense and genuine intelligence lay hidden beneath
Effie&#8217;s unfailing flow of high spirits.</p>

<p>Her smile did not in the least degree resemble
the ready &#8220;lip service&#8221; of her stepmother, and it
could give place in a moment to a very serious
and earnest sort of meaning, and George Brayton
caught himself, before long, suggesting subjects
of talk and turning over one idea after another,
for no better reason than simply to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the shadows chase the sunshine on Euphemia
Dryer&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>A very dangerous sort of amusement for a
young man to indulge in. At all events, when
the drive had lasted longer than the sober-minded
Mrs. Dryer would have at all approved&mdash;the
very thought of it had soured the Dorcas
Society for her all that afternoon&mdash;George
Brayton delivered Effie at her father&#8217;s door, took
back the fast mare to Runner&#8217;s stable, and then
walked up the main street of Ogleport with an
idea that it was in every way a pleasanter sort of
village than he had hitherto imagined.</p>

<p>He reached the green just as the boys&mdash;an unusually
large crowd of them&mdash;were winding up a
tremendous game of baseball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been a tough one, I should say,&#8221; remarked
George to himself. &#8220;Looks as if every fourth
boy had tried to catch the ball in his mouth and
got it on his nose. I begin to wonder how Zeb
Fuller would look without a black eye. Bar and
Val, though, seem to have escaped. I must put
Bar through his Greek to-night. He can&#8217;t have
fished to-day quite long enough to learn the
grammar by heart. He&#8217;s a remarkable boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>If Brayton had been within hearing just after
the Rev. Dr. Solomon Dryer left the green that
afternoon, his admiration might have been transferred
to Zebedee Fuller himself, for that cautious
youth had followed up his magnanimous surrender
by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, boys. We&#8217;ve had our boxing lesson,
but it won&#8217;t do now not to do up our
baseball. Old Sol mustn&#8217;t be allowed a peg to
hang his hat on. Our young friends from the
prize-ring will comprehend the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean Val and me,&#8221; said Bar, laughing,
&#8220;we&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>But that game of ball!</p>

<p>Never had Ogleport witnessed anything so
curiously bewildering since the Indian braves
finished their own last &#8220;match game&#8221; and carried
their clubs away with them.</p>

<p>The ball was here, there, everywhere. Ins and
outs found themselves mysteriously mixed up.
No fellow could tell who it was that started him
wrong.</p>

<p>There was really no redeeming feature to the
whole matter, except Bar Vernon&#8217;s marvelous
pitching and batting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>&#8220;Hiram Allen!&#8221; exclaimed Zeb to his lieutenant,
&#8220;that fellow is a treasure to the Academy.
We can play the Rodney nine now, and beat them
all to flinders. How does your poor old nose feel,
my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat &#8217;em? Yes,&#8221; replied Hy; &#8220;but see
where he&#8217;s sent the ball. My nose feels like a
mashed potato. Zeb, we must get him to teach
us how, and then we can whale all Rodney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all Rodney stands in moral need of
chastisement,&#8221; responded Zeb. &#8220;I must consult
the deacons about it, first one I meet. Are you
sure which side you are on, Hiram?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; growled Hiram, &#8220;but Bar
Vernon&#8217;s on the winning side, whichever
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;I don&#8217;t propose to
have any more personal collisions with Mr. Vernon.
He is a very excellent young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the game of ball, with all its manifold
perplexities, was played out at last, and Zebedee
was expressing his satisfaction at the result to
Bar and Val, when his left eye caught a glimpse
of George Brayton coming up the street, and he
remarked as much.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;I must go home and have
my Greek lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Greek?&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;Is not that one
of the ancient tongues?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I suppose so,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I
looked into it for the first time to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your hand,&#8221; said Zeb, enthusiastically.
&#8220;I&#8217;m proud to meet a man of your age
who can say that. But do you really mean to
study it this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. That&#8217;s what I came here for&mdash;Greek
and the rest of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then so will I,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;I have striven
for years to stir up old Sol and myself on the
Greek question, but have failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>A mournful failure it had been, although Zeb
had not been a bad scholar in some other
branches. He had studied, in fact, as most boys
do under teachers like Dr. Dryer, very much as
it had pleased him.</p>

<p>As a general thing it does not please them to
do much hard work in Greek, and so they end
by knowing even less about it than do their &#8220;instructors,&#8221;
to put it very strongly.</p>

<p>Bar and Val were off now to join Brayton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and in a few minutes more the latter had begun
to forget his pleasant &#8220;drive&#8221; in his curiosity
over the results of Bar&#8217;s first attempt at the
grand old language.</p>

<p>It was little more than very successful
&#8220;memorizing,&#8221; of course, but Brayton saw that
a good deal could be done with a memory like
that, and he was especially delighted at having
so promising a pupil.</p>

<p>He was not yet so experienced or so enthusiastic
a teacher as to have rejoiced over the acquisition
of a &#8220;dull boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>No teacher is a thoroughly good one till he
reaches that point.</p>

<p>When he gets to it, however, he is safe to enjoy
himself for the remainder of his life, for the
supply of dull boys is as sure as frost in November.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty tough game of ball you boys had to-day,&#8221;
said Brayton, after the lesson was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good game,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;Bar plays like a
professional.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the way so many of them got
battered?&#8221; asked Brayton.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Val; &#8220;they got that in the
boxing lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>&#8220;Boxing lesson?&#8221; exclaimed Brayton. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t you use gloves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were in too much of a hurry for that,&#8221;
replied Bar. &#8220;In fact, Dr. Dryer seemed to
disapprove of it. He came out and stopped us
before it was finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hum! Yes. I think I see how it was,&#8221;
said Brayton. &#8220;You&#8217;d better wear gloves next
time, Bar. You&#8217;ve knocked quite a piece of skin
off your left hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That?&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Oh, Hy Allen ran his
head against it. He has a very hard head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brayton took Bar&#8217;s injured hand and deliberately
felt of his arm, muttering to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard as iron. How came he ever to get
into such training as that at his age? Something
very unusual,&#8221; and then he added aloud:
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll get you to help me keep the peace
this term. Hy Allen won&#8217;t want to try that
again very soon, and I think the rest will agree
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Brayton had but known it, Zeb Fuller and
his friends were &#8220;agreeing&#8221; to that very thing
at that moment, as they gathered in council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
around the log at the mill-dam. Their coming
determination was expressed in the words of Bill
Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell ye what, fellers, we shan&#8217;t feel sure
about them city chaps till we&#8217;ve had &#8217;em down
here for a swim. We didn&#8217;t let &#8217;em come last
term, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; replied Zeb Fuller. &#8220;It&#8217;s our
duty to see they keep themselves clean. Oh, if
I could but persuade Solomon to soak in the
pond for a while at the bottom of it!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>GHOSTS IN THE ACADEMY BELFRY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was one man who had never been able
to get Bar Vernon fairly out of his head since
the first day he saw him, and that man was old
Judge Danvers.</p>

<p>Not but that the busy lawyer had plenty of
other things to occupy him, but there was something
in Bar and his mysterious &#8220;old time&#8221;
which was well calculated to excite the curiosity
of one whose whole life had been spent in solving
&#8220;riddles&#8221; of one kind or another.</p>

<p>&#8220;That black valise,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I
admire Bar&#8217;s honesty about it, and of course he
must keep his word, but I&#8217;m under no such bond.
I think I must manage to get hold of that
Major Montague. He&#8217;ll be a hard one to find,
if he chooses to keep out of the way. Sorry Dr.
Manning didn&#8217;t temporize with him a little. I
doubt if he will come near my office again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
There&#8217;s something about the premises that doesn&#8217;t
suit his fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Montague had reasons of his own for
not fancying anything which reminded him of
the law, but just now, as we have seen, he would
have been meeting the wishes of Judge Danvers
a good deal more than halfway if it had not
been for insurmountable difficulties.</p>

<p>The old lawyer was in quite a &#8220;brown study&#8221;
over what might or might not be the best way
to find the Major, when his office-boy brought
him in a card, and with it a note of introduction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashbel Norton!&#8221; said the Judge, as he
glanced at the card and then opened the note.
&#8220;Ah, an Englishman. Brown Brothers, bankers.
Introduction enough for any man. Show
the gentleman in.&#8221;</p>

<p>A very English-looking person, indeed, with
light hair and whiskers, and it seemed to the
judge that he very much resembled somebody he
knew, though he could not say whom.</p>

<p>The usual formalities of such a call were rapidly
completed, for, as the banker&#8217;s introduction
had stated, the stranger required the old lawyer&#8217;s
professional advice and services.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>&#8220;Very curious case, indeed,&#8221; he said, as he
laid a bundle of papers on the table. &#8220;Involves
family secrets&mdash;very unpleasant things, you
know. Not the affair I&#8217;d intrust to any ordinary
man, I assure you. There&#8217;s really a good deal at
stake, my dear sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Judge dryly professed his readiness to pay
attention, although he could not, somehow, prevent
his thoughts even then from wandering to
Bar Vernon and Major Montague.</p>

<p>Whether or not the stranger was favorably
impressed with the manner of his &#8220;counsel,&#8221; he
promptly began to open his budget, accompanying
the action with such verbal explanations as
seemed to be required.</p>

<p>It was a strange story, though Judge Danvers
had heard others somewhat resembling it, and
before long he found himself taking a deeper and
deeper interest, and Mr. Norton expressed himself
surprised, in their subsequent conversation, at
finding how thoroughly the lawyer had made
himself acquainted with the outlines of his case.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first thing to be done,&#8221; remarked the
Judge, &#8220;is to set the detectives on the track of
all these items of information. They are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
slender as yet. Mere hints. That will take
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied Mr. Norton, &#8220;I expect
that. Am ready to spend as much time, and
money, too, as may be necessary. I am quite at
your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take a trip of a week to Niagara, or
any other place where you can enjoy yourself,
and by the time you return I will be ready to report
what I have discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I not aid you in your proposed search?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After that,&#8221; replied the Judge. &#8220;Is not this
your first visit to America?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed,&#8221; said Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then try to make the most of it,&#8221; said
Judge Danvers. &#8220;There&#8217;s no telling where you
may have to travel before we get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbel Norton was apparently a gentleman
accustomed to having his own way, but he
was old enough to know there was little to be
gained in a dispute with a lawyer, and so, after
answering a legion of what seemed to him unimportant
questions, he bowed himself out, promising
to return at the end of the week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very curious affair,&#8221; growled Judge Danvers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
after his new client had departed. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve
two family mysteries on my hands&mdash;one from
England, and one from I don&#8217;t know where.
Well, I&#8217;ll set the wires a-working on this one, but,
for all that, I won&#8217;t neglect the other. I must
find that rascal, Montague, and then I must write
to Barnaby. No, not that, I must go to see
him; but I&#8217;d like to find the Major first.&#8221;</p>

<p>A busy head was that of the old lawyer that
afternoon and evening, what with one case and
another; but not one whit more active than had
been the brains of the two youngsters, away up
there in Ogleport.</p>

<p>At the supper table Brayton remarked to Mrs.
Wood:</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun went down in a great pile of clouds.
Looks very much as if a storm were brewing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout time for one,&#8221; replied the landlady.
&#8220;I kind o&#8217; feel it in my bones. Not that I&#8217;m at
all superstitious, only maybe it&#8217;s rheumatism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Superstitious?&#8221; remarked Val, maliciously.
&#8220;Mr. Brayton, do you believe in ghosts?&#8221;</p>

<p>Brayton had heard all that there was to hear
about the village legends, and he was just &#8220;boy&#8221;
enough to answer:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say, Val; but I never saw one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or heard one?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nor heard one,&#8221; said Brayton; &#8220;but I
believe I should like to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghosts!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Wood. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose
it was ghosts that tied poor Dr. Dryer&#8217;s dun
heifer to the bell rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;That&#8217;s the kind I
imagine there are more of than any other. All
very good ghosts till they are found out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t found out that one,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet they haven&#8217;t,&#8221; snapped Mrs. Wood;
&#8220;but I believe his right name is Zebedee
Fuller.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing very ghostly about Zeb,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor the heifer,&#8221; added Val.</p>

<p>Just then there came a pretty good gust of
wind through the open window of the dining-room,
and the two young conspirators could
scarcely avoid a sly glance into each other&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>It was a very quick flash of a glance, but
George Brayton caught it.</p>

<p>He could not guess at its meaning just then,
but he stored it away in his memory for future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
reference, for it meant, as plainly as anything
could, &#8220;Fun a-coming. Wait and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he determined to do that very thing, and
went on with his supper.</p>

<p>The night promised to be a dark and stormy
one by the time the boys had a chance to look
out on it. All the more so because the weather
seemed disposed to take its own time in getting
ready.</p>

<p>The two friends retired to their own room, and
Bar astonished Val by actually going to work on
his books.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer fellow,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;Why,
I&#8217;m all ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but I mean to improve
my time, for all that. This wind&#8217;ll do our work
for us without any help of ours. Seems as if it
was getting more and more westerly all the
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it required all the resolution Bar
could muster to do anything worth while with
his Greek, and Val vainly endeavored to find
anything interesting in one of Kingsley&#8217;s best
novels.</p>

<p>So long a time went by, in fact, that even Bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
began to have half a fear that his machinery had
got &#8220;stuck&#8221; in some way.</p>

<p>So it had, for there had been more than a little
rust on those old wheels, and, in spite of the oil,
the &#8220;wing&#8221; had to work back and forth a good
while before it had rubbed them into anything
like easy running order.</p>

<p>Then the wind, too, at first, had come only in
fitful and insufficient gusts, and not from the
right direction, and so the good people of Ogleport,
early sleepers and early risers, had a fine
opportunity to stow themselves away in bed before
the &#8220;ghosts&#8221; got fairly loose in the
belfry.</p>

<p>Not all of them were sufficiently easy in their
minds to go to sleep at once, however, and Mrs.
Dryer had just remarked to the Doctor, as a sort
of clincher to a good many other things she had
been saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fond of fast horses, too, Dr. Dryer; that&#8217;s
the kind of man you&#8217;ve got. The Academy&#8217;s all
going to destruction. Riding &#8217;round the country
in buggies. Effie, too, what do you say to that?
Boys fighting on the green and calling it boxing lessons.
Threatening to drown you in the mill-pond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Tying your cow&#8217;s horns to the bell-rope.
Buying boats on the lake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane,&#8221; began the principal, but he
was suddenly interrupted by a deep, mournful,
booming sound from the Academy belfry, and an
exclamation from his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy on us, Doctor, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane,&#8221; replied the Doctor, as he
slowly arose in bed, &#8220;can it be within the compass
of mundane possibilities that that outrageous
cow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cow? Poor thing!&#8221; returned his
&#8220;third,&#8221; disdainfully. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you ashamed, Dr.
Dryer! Do you suppose she&#8217;d be out on such a
night as this? Listen to the rain on the window.
There it is again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane!&#8221; exclaimed the Doctor, as he
sprang to his feet and began to dress himself,
&#8220;this proceeding should arouse all Ogleport!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That bell!&#8221; mourned Mrs. Dryer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; replied the Doctor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
terrible affliction.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Brayton also heard the first sound
made by the bell, and it somehow put him in
mind of his two young friends, although he well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
knew they were at that very moment in their
room.</p>

<p>He was sure of it, if from nothing else, by the
unnecessary amount of racket Bar Vernon was
making in getting on his boots.</p>

<p>Fiercer and higher rose the strength of that
reckless wind from the west, and louder and
more prolonged, though terribly irregular were
the clamorous peals from the Academy belfry, till
not a sleeper remained in all Ogleport, except the
stone-deaf grandmother of Zeb Fuller&#8217;s friend,
William Jones.</p>

<p>The worst puzzled pair of ears in all the village,
however, were those of Zebedee himself.</p>

<p>Not only on account of the bell, but because
Deacon Fuller had deemed that tolling a direct
summons to the bedroom of his son, and it had
required all his fatherly faith in Zeb&#8217;s truthfulness
to convince him that the mischief, whatever
it might be, would never be traced across his own
threshold.</p>

<p>That was very bad&mdash;so bad that Zeb enjoyed
the rare luxury of looking upon himself in the
character of injured innocence, but the very worst
of it was that here was something going on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
his own Ogleport of which he knew no more than
did &#8220;old Sol&#8221; himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be looked to, father!&#8221; he solemnly
declared. &#8220;It can hardly be the dun heifer can
so soon again have forgotten herself. There&#8217;s
been nothing going on that I know of, that the
old bell need wake up and toll about at this time
o&#8217; night. We&#8217;d better go and make an investigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were plenty more of the same way of
thinking, and now they were gathering at the
Academy door, some with umbrellas and some
without, and not a few of them had brought
along their lanterns.</p>

<p>And now the door was opened by the Rev. Dr.
Dryer in person, as on the previous occasion, and
the whole crowd, variously half-clad, were glad
enough to get in out of the rain.</p>

<p>There was the mystery, however, right before
them.</p>

<p>No rope, no cow, and the old bell banging
ceaselessly away, up there in the steeple.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s working tip-top,&#8221; whispered a cautious
voice in Bar Vernon&#8217;s ear. &#8220;You said as how
the fun&#8217;d come the first windy night, and I footed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
it over arter my sheer. It&#8217;s most as good as
boat-buildin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Puff; only keep still,&#8221; returned
Bar. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what they&#8217;ll do about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were other volunteers to go up with
George Brayton that night, however, and although
Zebedee Fuller crept along behind one of
the trustees, he did not seem disposed to make
himself at all conspicuous.</p>

<p>He had noted the presence of Bar and Val, but
had promptly dismissed them from his calculations
with the silent question:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do city fellows know about bells?&#8221;</p>

<p>Not much, perhaps, but the dripping investigators
soon began to suspect that they themselves
knew even less, for they failed to detect any sign
of rope on the second floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my friends!&#8221; exclaimed the principal,
triumphantly, &#8220;whoever the perpetrators may be,
we are reasonably assured of their capture.
They have lingered too long in the steeple!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; muttered Zeb; &#8220;nobody ever
engineered a dun heifer up those crooked stairs.
It was a tough enough job to get her into the
lower hall.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>But not on the stairs, nor even to the adventurous
eyes which shortly afterwards peered out
upon the &#8220;deck&#8221; above, did there appear any
sign of boy or man or apple-hunting cow.</p>

<p>Such a gale as was sweeping through the sashless
frame of the bell-tower and across the vacant
level of the deck at that moment!</p>

<p>It laid the wing of Bar Vernon&#8217;s subtle invention
so very flat that the tolling ceased and even
the uplifted lanterns failed to discover it.</p>

<p>The combined light of the latter, moreover,
convinced the keen eyes of George Brayton that
no human form was lurking among the cross-pieces
of the bell-frame in its nook overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a living soul, there or here,&#8221; solemnly
exclaimed one of the trustees.</p>

<p>&#8220;No rope,&#8221; added another.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an awful mystery,&#8221; exclaimed a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghosts from Mrs. Wood&#8217;s,&#8221; suggested a sepulchral
voice behind them, and although they all
knew it came from the lips of Zebedee Fuller,
there was a very general disposition to regard
their search as completed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got away, whoever he was,&#8221; remarked
George Brayton, &#8220;but the question is, how?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>Did the bell mean to laugh at them?</p>

<p>They were halfway down the stairway just
then, and the tolling burst forth in a sudden fit
of half frantic violence that almost made one of
the trustees lose his footing.</p>

<p>That was quite enough for George Brayton,
however, and he quietly said to the rest:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back. Please tell Mr. Vernon I
wish he would come up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re in for it,&#8221; said Val, as he heard
the message delivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Val,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;it&#8217;s all right. If I don&#8217;t
go up they&#8217;ll find it out. I must shut it off for
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I come along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not. One&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>One would indeed have been enough, and Zeb
Fuller made two. That would have been altogether
too much, if there had not somehow dimly
dawned on Zebedee&#8217;s mind the idea that it was
his duty to keep George Brayton&#8217;s attention as
much as possible.</p>

<p>Bar found the two sitting together at the top
of the stairs waiting for him, but he stepped
lightly past them and out upon the deck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>It was the work of an instant, as he seemed to
peer out upon the roof through that western
window. The end of the rope was detached
from the lower &#8220;arm&#8221; of the van and there was
no danger of any more noise just then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vernon,&#8221; said Brayton, &#8220;do you think you
could climb up there such a night as this without
danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar&#8217;s reply, to the intense admiration of Zeb
Fuller, who would scarcely have undertaken it
himself, except as out-and-out &#8220;mischief,&#8221; was to
climb rapidly and lightly up, till he reached the
rafters beside the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody here, Mr. Brayton,&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;Nobody&#8217;d want to sit here and toll, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down, then. I thought as much,&#8221; replied
Brayton.</p>

<p>Bar was down with the rapidity of a young
monkey, for he now knew every inch of the
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you examined the roof?&#8221; he asked of
Brayton.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply; &#8220;it&#8217;s too wet and slippery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
for any one to venture on to-night, and it&#8217;s
too dark for us to see all over it. I&#8217;m afraid
we&#8217;ll have to give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They waited for sometime, nevertheless, visited
at brief intervals by other watchers from
below, but no renewal of the mysterious sounds
disturbed them.</p>

<p>In fact, the wind was dying away now, having
lasted a good while for a summer gust, and when
at last Brayton led the way down-stairs, Zeb
went next, and Bar had a precious moment in
which he was able to step back and once more
slip the end of the tolling-rope over the arm of
the van.</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do any harm, right away,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;and there&#8217;s no telling when I may
have another chance to get up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once or twice, in the remaining course of that
eventful night, faint efforts at a clangor moaned
across the green through the still falling rain, but
there was not enough of them to draw the villagers
again from their houses.</p>

<small>THE BELL MYSTERY REMAINS UNSOLVED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> say that the usual amount of sleeping was
done in Ogleport that night would be to trifle
with truth but, for all that, everybody was
astir bright and early the next morning.</p>

<p>Why not, when there would be so remarkable
an opportunity for everybody to ask everybody
else:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Zeb Fuller&#8217;s name was less frequently on
the lips of men than on the former occasion, for
this was something apparently beyond him.</p>

<p>And yet Zeb&#8217;s &#8220;chores&#8221; had been done at railway
speed that morning, and there was that in
his eyes which might have been very suggestive
to a man that knew him well.</p>

<p>Hardly had Bar and Val finished their breakfast
before word was brought them by Mrs.
Wood that the Fuller boy was asking for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
&#8220;And you&#8217;d better look out for him or he&#8217;ll get
you into all sorts of difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zebedee&#8217;s errand was a very peaceful and
proper one, however, for he merely proposed to
join them in their day on the lake, if they were
going, and to show them some things he reckoned
they had not yet seen.</p>

<p>It is possible that George Brayton would have
willingly kept Bar and Val within reach that
day, but they were off with Zeb before he had a
chance to offer any objection. Very quiet was
Zeb, till the three were well out of the village,
and then he turned suddenly upon Bar, with:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d ha&#8217; found it out, after all, if it hadn&#8217;t
been for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Bar, somewhat taken by surprise,
&#8220;did you find it out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say I did,&#8221; said Zeb, as if ashamed of
such a confession, &#8220;but I knew that rope along
the timber and under that wheel had something
to do with it. So I kept between him and that
as much as I could.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_288.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">He&#8217;d ha&#8217; Found It Out, if It Hadn&#8217;t been for Me</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a trump, Zeb,&#8221; shouted Bar. &#8220;I wondered
myself how it was he failed to see that,
dark as it was, when they had so many lanterns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
But there they were, all of them looking up and
couldn&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brayton&#8217;s was the only good pair of eyes
among &#8217;em,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;and he was looking up,
too, most of the time. But will it toll again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; exclaimed Zeb; &#8220;there isn&#8217;t
another chap in or about Ogleport that can do
that belfry climbing. Brayton understands that
as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he does,&#8221; said Val, thoughtfully.
&#8220;If there should be a wind this afternoon,
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s it, is it?&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t I think of that before? I give it up.
You fellows beat me. To think that I should
never have thought of the wind!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was little more to be done except to explain
the exact particulars, and when Bar had
done that, Zeb stopped in front of him and removed
from his head the broad-brimmed and
somewhat battered &#8220;straw,&#8221; saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnaby Vernon, you can take my hat. I
think I must emigrate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Emigrate?&#8221; said Val Manning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Zeb, dolefully; &#8220;there isn&#8217;t room
for him and me in the same village. And yet I
must remain and see how he and Solomon will
work together. Old Sol has his eye on you, my
boy, but you needn&#8217;t be afraid of George Brayton.
I&#8217;ve great confidence in George.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the boys were not the only part of the village
population that continued to be exercised
about the bell business.</p>

<p>Dr. Dryer instituted what he called &#8220;an exhaustive
analysis of the mysterious phenomenon&#8221;
at an early hour in the forenoon, but he never
put his head above the &#8220;deck,&#8221; and he acquired
no additional wisdom.</p>

<p>Brayton had deemed his own search of the
previous night sufficient for the present, and he
had, besides, some private matters of his own to
attend to that day.</p>

<p>His morning mail had brought him news of
some of these, and had sent him to Mrs. Wood
with a request that she would prepare a room
for his mother and sister, who were coming to
pay him a visit.</p>

<p>There was no reason, thought his landlady,
why he should get so very much flushed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
face about it; but George Brayton did not care
the rest of that day whether the Academy had
one bell or ten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dryer did, however, and she talked
&#8220;bell&#8221; till her pretty stepdaughter could stand
it no longer, but put on her bonnet for a very
aimless flight among her neighbors.</p>

<p>There, too, it was the bell, the bell, till poor
Effie reached a state of mind which led her to
say to George Brayton, when she met him crossing
the green:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t speak to me. I don&#8217;t want to
hear another word about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; asked the very much astonished
young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;That dreadful bell!&#8221; exclaimed Effie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;d forgotten there was one,&#8221; replied
Brayton. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve good news this morning.
My mother and sister are coming to see
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How very pleasant!&#8221; interrupted Effie;
&#8220;and they know nothing about the bell&mdash;there,
my hat. Oh, dear me! there it goes again!&#8221;</p>

<p>There it went, sure enough, Effie&#8217;s very pretty
hat, with George Brayton after it halfway across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the green, and at that moment and with the
breath of that one sudden gust, the obnoxious
character in the steeple had uttered a grating
and sonorous warning that there was life and
mischief in him yet.</p>

<p>Just that one malicious effort did the village
monster make, but that was enough, and in five
minutes more there were a hundred pairs of eyes
straining up at the steeple on all sides, and Dr.
Dryer, accompanied by his faithful &#8220;third,&#8221; was
striding across the green with the key in his hand.</p>

<p>Even in that moment of concentrated thought
and feeling, however, Mrs. Dryer&#8217;s vision swept
in all the surrounding circumstances, and she exclaimed,
in the tone of an injured angel:</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so. There&#8217;s Effie with George
Brayton out there on the green, and she&#8217;s bare-headed,
too. It&#8217;s awful! There, he&#8217;s had her
hat in his hand. Doctor, what do you say to
such doings? Are you a post?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A humble pillar, I hope, Dorothy Jane,&#8221; replied
the Doctor, but there was no time for anything
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not going to help them?&#8221; asked
Effie of Brayton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>&#8220;No, indeed. Why should I?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;There&#8217;s enough of &#8217;em now. Too many, in fact.
Besides, if they find out what&#8217;s the matter, they&#8217;ll
be sure to let the rest of us know.&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked very much as if the young man was
right, but the curious part of it was, after all,
that not one of that crowd, nor all of them together,
did more than rummage the Academy
after hidden human beings.</p>

<p>They were all equally sure that there was no one
up in the belfry, and so that part of the building
was left to keep its own secrets and those of Mrs.
Wood&#8217;s ghosts.</p>

<p>Meantime, George Brayton and Effie had the
pleasantest kind of a walk and talk, and Mrs.
Dryer was enabled to bottle-up an immense
amount of wrath against her next meeting with
her stepdaughter.</p>

<p>In fact, when that much-disturbed lady came out
of the Academy, after the fruitless raid of the villagers,
she was unable to so much as even smile
in the bewildered faces of her neighbors, thereby
sending them all away with a deeper sense than
ever of the gloomy depth of the cloud which seemed
to be settling over Ogleport and its Academy.</p>

<small>MAJOR MONTAGUE HAS A VISITOR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning after the visit of Mr. Ashbel
Norton, old Judge Danvers was opening his
mail. He had spent a good part of the previous
evening with Dr. Manning, and the remainder
with a pair of the best &#8220;detectives&#8221; in
the city. There was evidently something heavy
weighing upon his mind, for he tore open his letters,
one by one, and seemed to glance over them
almost mechanically.</p>

<p>That is, he did so until, as he looked listlessly
into one of them, he gave a sudden start and almost
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>That was a good deal for such a man, but his
next movement was to ring his table-bell, and
send out in all haste for a carriage, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to see him at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Major Montague had
company of the most respectable sort in the reception-room
of his compulsory boarding-house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>The great iron-barred doors of the sombre
building had opened almost obsequiously, to admit
Judge Danvers, and the Major himself had
been surprised at so prompt a response to his
venturesome letter. Perhaps he failed to see
that nothing could better have suited the Judge,
if he cared to find him at all, than to find him
under just those very circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can get me out of this, easily enough,&#8221;
he said, after a brief conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; calmly responded the lawyer,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t see very clearly why I should meddle
with it. I&#8217;m on the other side, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other side?&#8221; asked the Major.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Vernon&#8217;s,&#8221; replied the Judge. &#8220;So
long as you&#8217;re locked up here I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t
bother him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said the Major with a leer that
was meant to be very knowing; &#8220;but as long as
I&#8217;m here I&#8217;ll keep my mouth shut as to some
things he&#8217;d like very much to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A year will settle that now,&#8221; replied the
Judge, &#8220;if I don&#8217;t find it out sooner. Meantime,
he&#8217;s doing very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might lose a good deal in a year,&#8221; suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the Major. &#8220;I&#8217;m really Bar&#8217;s friend, and
I wouldn&#8217;t like to see him do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then tell me what you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till I&#8217;m out of this,&#8221; exclaimed the Major,
with great energy, &#8220;and not till I see those papers.
There&#8217;s things that nobody else can explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied the Judge, thoughtfully, &#8220;I
think I&#8217;ll go to work about you. Take two or
three days, you know. And even then I&#8217;ll fix it
so you&#8217;ll walk right back here again if you break
your word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Montague must have felt even surer
about the lawyer&#8217;s power in the premises than
he did himself, so abjectly and earnestly did he
labor to assure the Judge of the honesty of his
intentions.</p>

<p>A few days in prison will sometimes have a
wonderfully quieting and sobering effect, and the
Major was just the sort of man to yield to such
an agency.</p>

<p>Judge Danvers left the prison feeling as if he
had somehow stumbled upon a very promising
piece of work, but he had a good deal more before
him that day, and he meant to be out of the
city on the evening train.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>As for Major Montague, after the lawyer&#8217;s departure
and his return to his own very narrow
quarters, he sunk upon his cot bed with a remarkably
sulky expression of countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t told him anything,&#8221; he muttered;
&#8220;but he&#8217;s bound to know. I reckon I can always
keep some kind of a hold on Barnaby, but there
ain&#8217;t any ready money to be made out of the
Judge. Never mind; I&#8217;ll see my way to something
before I get through with &#8217;em all. See if I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar Vernon&#8217;s affairs were in good hands, beyond
a doubt, and no man of Major Montague&#8217;s
calibre was likely to &#8220;get up much earlier in the
morning&#8221; than Bar&#8217;s self-appointed counsel.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Bar had a good deal of a surprise
in store for him.</p>

<p>The days had now followed one another until
the regular time for &#8220;opening the Academy&#8221;
was close at hand, and nearly all things were in
readiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar,&#8221; said Brayton, that night, after another
tug at the Greek, &#8220;you and I can fix the rope on
the bell to-morrow evening, can&#8217;t we, without
calling in anybody else?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>&#8220;Val and I can do it in ten minutes without
troubling you at all,&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
give us the key in the morning we&#8217;ll attend to it
right after breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing dull about George Brayton,
but he seemed to fall into Bar&#8217;s proposition as
easily as Gershom Todderley had fallen into the
mill-pond.</p>

<p>He must have had a good deal on his mind,
indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said Val, as they were getting
ready for bed, &#8220;we must take Zeb Fuller along.
It&#8217;s only fair after what he did the other
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;School begins next
day after, and we must have Zeb pull with us or
we&#8217;ll lose half the fun of the term.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in the morning in securing
Zeb&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>The only trouble was in avoiding the additional
presence of half the boys in the village.</p>

<p>The first consequence was that Zebedee had a
good look at Bar Vernon&#8217;s invention, for which
he had been aching, and the second was, that the
rope was rigged over the big wheel for ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
&#8220;ringing&#8221; purposes, without any special disturbance
of the extraordinary &#8220;tolling gear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latter had to be unhitched, indeed, but
was left all ready for use at any time when a
high west wind should conspire with other favoring
circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly understand, even now,&#8221; remarked
Zeb, as they were coming out of the
Academy, &#8220;how it was that Brayton failed to discover
that thing at the time, or else to hunt it
out afterwards. Depend upon it, boys, there&#8217;s
something the matter with George.&#8221;</p>

<p>He scarcely had the words out of his mouth
before their path was crossed by the very hasty
feet of Effie Dryer, though where she could be
going was not so clear as Zeb thought it ought to
be even to him.</p>

<p>One brief glance and a nod was all the notice
she gave them, but in so doing she turned her
face full upon them for a moment, and Zeb immediately
turned to his friends with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that, boys? Euphemia&#8217;s been
crying. That stepmother of hers! Or can it be
old Sol himself has been cutting up? It&#8217;s a very
distressing case.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;Well, because that
young woman has no proper knowledge of the
art of crying. The only thing she understands
well is laughing. I declare, if old Sol and his
wife are going to put that kind of work upon
Euphemia!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Zebedee looked as if it might indeed turn
out badly for Solomon in such a case.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was so full of preparations
for &#8220;school-opening&#8221; that there was really
no chance for anything else, and the Ogleport
boys were pretty generally on their good behavior.</p>

<p>Even Puff Evans was left to hammer away at
his new boat, all day, without the sign of a
temptation to leave it and go fishing.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, however, when the stage
from the north came lumbering in, Bar Vernon
and Val Manning had better been at home.</p>

<p>George Brayton was, and he had no one to
help him in with his mother and Sibyl. He
seemed perfectly well satisfied about it, however,
and spent all the rest of the time with them till
the supper bell rang.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Then, indeed, for the first time in his life, Bar
Vernon found out what a genuinely bashful boy
he could be.</p>

<p>Of course he was glad to see Sibyl and her
mother. So was Val Manning. But then Val
seemed so altogether at ease and unconcerned
about it, and did not once blush or stammer,
while poor Bar did both.</p>

<p>In fact, he felt altogether unsafe about his
neck-tie, his shirt-collar, and the way his hair
was brushed. He&#8217;d have given half his money
on hand for a good look in his glass up-stairs.</p>

<p>He was very sure, nevertheless, that there was
not a prettier girl in all the world than Sibyl
Brayton.</p>

<p>He and Val did their best to amuse the newcomers
during the evening, and it was very good
of Effie Dryer to come in and help them, only
Sibyl deemed her brother unnecessarily long in
seeing the Doctor&#8217;s daughter home, at the end of
it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of it is,&#8221; said Bar to Val, when
they were in their own room, &#8220;we are to have
lots of ladies and other visitors at the chapel to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Val, &#8220;but it doesn&#8217;t amount to
anything. They never ask a fellow anything
they aren&#8217;t sure he knows. It&#8217;s just for all the
world like an examination-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s awful, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Val, &#8220;it&#8217;s an awful fraud, unless
one of the teachers has a grudge against
you. Then it&#8217;s a fraud, too, only there&#8217;s good
fun in it, &#8217;specially if they&#8217;re at work on Zeb
Fuller.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day was destined to be an interesting
one for Bar Vernon, however, for other reasons
than the arrival of Sibyl Brayton and her mother.</p>

<p>The increasing numbers of the people of all
sorts, scholars included, compelled a transfer of
the &#8220;exercises&#8221; to the &#8220;great hall&#8221; on the second
floor of the Academy building.</p>

<p>Bar rather liked that at first, but the stage
from the South arrived before the bell had done
ringing, and the next thing he knew there was
an addition to the &#8220;distinguished guests,&#8221; as
Mrs. Dryer would have described the highly respectable
people on the &#8220;platform,&#8221; that not
only deeply impressed &#8220;old Sol&#8221; himself, but
sent all the blood in Bar&#8217;s body to his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>How he and the rest got through with the
&#8220;opening&#8221; business he could scarcely have told,
but he knew there was something unusual coming
for him or Val, when he saw Judge Danvers
waiting for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very promising young gentlemen, your
ward and the son of Dr. Manning,&#8221; he heard
Dr. Dryer say, as they were edging their
way through the crowd. &#8220;My assistant, Mr.
Brayton, has them under his especial charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were very near now; but somebody else
was nearer, and had caught the meaning of the
principal&#8217;s last remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; said Zebedee Fuller, gravely, as he
held out his hand, &#8220;I&#8217;m proud to meet you, but
are you responsible for sending Bar Vernon to
Ogleport?&#8221;</p>

<p>For once in his life Judge Danvers found himself
&#8220;on the witness-stand,&#8221; and all he could say
on the spur of the moment was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a very restricted sphere of usefulness
for such a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Zebedee marched solemnly on as if unconscious
that the eyes of Doctor and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Dryer, as well as half the Board of Trustees,
were following him with anything but a charitable
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Effie to Sibyl, &#8220;is the genius of
Ogleport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, Judge Danvers and Bar
were alone in the room of the latter at Mrs.
Wood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The Judge did not seem disposed to explain
very fully the cause of his coming, but shortly
came to it in this form:</p>

<p>&#8220;You brought that black valise with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did!&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly safe here. It ought to be under lock
and key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve no
place to put it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you trust it to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, and very glad to do so,&#8221; replied
Bar. &#8220;It&#8217;s only a trouble to me. I can&#8217;t even
open it, and sometimes I lie awake at nights, wondering
what there may be in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been almost up to that point myself,&#8221;
said the Judge. &#8220;I want to say one thing more.
I will keep your promise for you as to opening it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
unless I can get you formally released from it.
How is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing to say,&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;I never
did break my word, and I never mean to. That&#8217;s
all I care for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty safe then,&#8221; said the Judge.
&#8220;But tell me, who is this Mr. Brayton?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar gave him all the information in his power,
but Judge Danver&#8217;s face seemed to grow more
and more cloudily thoughtful all the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice people, all of them, no doubt,&#8221; he said,
at last; &#8220;but they may or may not be good
friends of yours. I won&#8217;t say any more just
now, only this: If you get a telegram from me to
come to the city, tell nobody but Val where you
are going, or why, and just come right along.
Have you money enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty!&#8221; said Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must be off. Take care of yourself,
my boy, and give my compliments to that Zebedee
Fuller. There&#8217;s the making of a man in
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judge Danvers probably meant &#8220;The making
of a lawyer,&#8221; for that was his highest ideal of
man&mdash;and perhaps he was not far wrong, considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the kind of lawyer he had made of himself.
And so Bar was left to apologize as best he might
to all inquirers for the sudden appearance and
disappearance of his &#8220;distinguished counsel.&#8221;</p>

<small>MR. ASHBEL NORTON</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening after the &#8220;opening exercises&#8221; at
the Academy, and after the sudden appearance in
Ogleport of the great city lawyer, and his equally
sudden departure, George Brayton was sitting
for awhile with his mother and sister in their
own room.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so your friend is to be here to-morrow?&#8221;
he asked of Mrs. Brayton.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not know yet if we can call him our
friend,&#8221; replied she, &#8220;but I wrote him we were
coming here, and he replied that this would be as
convenient as any other place. Now he writes
that he will arrive to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so like a romance,&#8221; began Sibyl, &#8220;I
can hardly believe it to be real, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Real or not real,&#8221; said George, &#8220;the legacy
will pay off our mortgages and make us very
comfortable. So I shan&#8217;t have to drudge out my
life at Ogleport with Dr. Dryer. Then if the rest
should come!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>&#8220;I feel almost sure it won&#8217;t,&#8221; exclaimed Sibyl.
&#8220;Seems to me it really belongs to some one else,
and I hope he may get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money is a very useful thing, Sibyl,&#8221; said
Mrs. Brayton, with a smile. &#8220;When you are
older you may not think so lightly of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, mother,&#8221; said George, &#8220;Sibyl is
right. Besides, we are very much in the dark
till we have heard the whole of the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, little as they might know, they
continued to discuss it until a much later hour
than those commonly kept by the boarders at
Mrs. Wood&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Bar and Val, in their own room, were at the
same time busily engaged in a discussion of the
several events of the day, including Judge Danvers
and Sibyl Brayton.</p>

<p>Bar, indeed, was more than usually frank with
his friend, and Val was beginning to take a
deeper interest than ever in his remarkable
chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Depend upon it, Bar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;old Judge
Danvers didn&#8217;t travel all the way up here for
nothing. I shall expect that telegram, now,
every day till it comes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>&#8220;So shall I,&#8221; replied Bar.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were destined to go on &#8220;expecting&#8221;
for more days than were at all comfortable
for the uneasy heads of such a pair of boys,
though Bar Vernon seemed to &#8220;bear up&#8221; under
the trial of his patience a good deal better than
did Val.</p>

<p>The next day, of course, was crammed full of
&#8220;school,&#8221; and Bar Vernon&#8217;s first surprise came in
the shape of a discovery that it would not be
half so hard as he had feared for him to keep up
with the several &#8220;classes&#8221; in which he found
himself.</p>

<p>He would, as Brayton showed him, have to do a
good deal of &#8220;back study,&#8221; going over a great deal
of ground that was all an old story to the rest;
but then, with such a memory as his and with
plucky hard work, he would soon make it all up.
Especially as in several important branches, he
would hardly have to study at all, as yet, and
could give his whole time to the things in which
he was &#8220;behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a hard day&#8217;s duty for George Brayton,
but he stuck to it manfully, although well
aware that his mother and sister and their very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
important visitor were impatiently waiting for
him most of the afternoon.</p>

<p>He managed to elude Dr. Dryer at the close,
however, and the boys themselves were hardly out
of the building more promptly than was the new
&#8220;assistant,&#8221; a circumstance which by no means
eluded the keen eyes of Effie Dryer&#8217;s stepmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mere eye-servant,&#8221; she assured the Doctor.
&#8220;That young man seems to consider himself entirely
independent of your control. To think of
his going away in that manner, without your permission!&#8221;</p>

<p>Dreadful, no doubt, but then Mrs. Dryer would
have given half her teeth, much as they cost, if
she had known who was waiting for him, and
what it was he hurried home to talk about.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son, Mr. George Brayton&mdash;Mr. Ashbel
Norton, George.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men stood for a moment looking at
each other, and then the Englishman remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy to meet you, Mr. Brayton. I&#8217;ve already
said nearly all I have to say, but we can
go over it again, if you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like it, indeed,&#8221; said George; &#8220;and
it seems to concern us both, if I understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>And then followed an hour of very earnest talk
ending with Brayton&#8217;s saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have done all that the circumstances
required. If he is not found, it will not
be your fault. Of course, you were careful in
your selection of counsel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; replied Norton. &#8220;My bankers
recommended me to a Judge Danvers, who seems
to stand very high&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danvers?&#8221; exclaimed George. &#8220;Why, he
was here yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here? Judge Danvers? Now, do you know
that seems very odd indeed! How very singular!
And to think I missed him so narrowly. But,
then, I suppose such a man has a good deal of
business on his hands besides our own. I&#8217;m going
on to meet him in a day or two. Indeed, he told
me to be gone a week, but I find I can&#8217;t stand it.
No fun at all, you know, with so much at
stake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; replied George, but he
found himself looking straight into the eyes of
his pretty sister.</p>

<p>Could it be that her quick and somewhat romantic
young brain had caught a glimpse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
same thought which was slowly dawning upon
his own?</p>

<p>Whether or not, neither of them said a word
about it then to each other, or even after Mr.
Ashbel Norton had retired to his own room; and
the stage carried him away next morning with no
other apparent result of his visit to Ogleport
than a conviction that Sibyl Brayton was the very
prettiest girl that he had ever seen in America,
and a determination that he would return at once
to the city and &#8220;see what that old fox of a lawyer
was up to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day of his departure was a Friday, and
when the Academy doors were closed they were
not to be opened again till Monday, for Dr.
Dryer had not yet perfected his usual plans for
robbing the boys of the morning half of their
weekly holiday. That would be sure to come, in
due time, but as yet the entire day was free.</p>

<p>Bar and Val had been getting up a plan of
their own, and it carried them, at their very best
pace, out to Puff Evans&#8217;s the moment that school
was out.</p>

<p>A long, fast, hot walk to be sure, but they
found Puff delighted to see them and to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
them what really marvelous progress he had
made upon his new boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You was right about Skinner,&#8221; he said to
Bar. &#8220;The old weasel had a feller down here,
snookin&#8217; &#8217;round and askin&#8217; questions. I jist
showed him everything and told him he could
go over and see you, if he wanted to buy any
one of the boats. He didn&#8217;t come, did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and he won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;but we must
have the <i>Mary</i> all ready to-morrow. You&#8217;ve
never painted her name on her. How long
would it take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do it in no time,&#8221; said Puff. &#8220;Be all dry in
the mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;ll have to be called the <i>Sibyl</i>, for
to-morrow,&#8221; said Bar, with more color than
usual in his face. &#8220;Paint it as nicely as you
can. When I sell her back to you, you can name
her over again if you choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Puff. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good
enough name for a boat, anyhow. I&#8217;ve seen
right big boats and nice ones, too, with the
meanest kind of names.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val Manning chuckled in Bar&#8217;s very face, as
Puff declared his not very complimentary assent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
but Bar seemed to have nothing to say, and they
went home to supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mrs. Brayton,&#8221; said Bar, just before
they left the table, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t a bit of danger,
and I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve consented. I&#8217;m sorry
you can&#8217;t go; but Mr. Brayton himself can take
care of Miss Sibyl. Then there&#8217;s one thing more
I have to ask of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Sibyl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m only a boy, you know, and I
wouldn&#8217;t dare to go over and ask Dr. Dryer&#8217;s
daughter to come, too. She&#8217;d be company for
you, and if you&#8217;d only do me the favor to ask
her for me, I&#8217;d be ever so much obliged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bar could hardly understand why Mrs. Brayton&#8217;s
eyebrows should contract so suddenly as
they did, or why George Brayton should so
promptly come to his support, with:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be just the thing, Sibyl. She&#8217;s tried
to be polite to you and mother, and I&#8217;m sure
she&#8217;d enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Mrs. Brayton had meant to put in any objection
it was too late now, for Sibyl was even
demonstrative in her readiness to secure the
company of Effie Dryer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>&#8220;She&#8217;s the merriest, sweetest, nicest girl,&#8221; exclaimed
Sibyl. &#8220;She&#8217;s years older than I am,
but she makes me feel perfectly at home with
her. Of course I may, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, my dear,&#8221; was Mrs. Brayton&#8217;s half
doubtful reply, but there must have been a vein
of mischief in Val Manning for he instantly proposed
to accompany Sibyl in her call at the
principal&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>It was curious that both Bar Vernon and George
Brayton should feel at the same moment, as if
they would like to see Val Manning tumble into
the mill-pond with his clothes on!</p>

<p>His goodness was its own reward, however,
for he had the happiness, shortly afterwards, of
being smiled on by Mrs. Dryer and preached
to by her husband for a round hour, while Sibyl
and Effie were having a good long talk all by
themselves.</p>

<p>When the latter came at last to Val&#8217;s rescue,
however, it suddenly became very difficult for
Mrs. Dryer to look sweet, for Effie&#8217;s first words
were, &#8220;So kind of Mrs. Brayton, is it not,
papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubtless, my daughter, but in what manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
has she exhibited her benevolence of disposition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t Mr. Manning told you? She
has sent Sibyl over to invite me to a ride in the
boat to-morrow. Mr. Brayton will go with us
and there won&#8217;t be any danger. I haven&#8217;t been
out on the lake for ever so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re going,&#8221; said Val,
promptly. &#8220;Puff Evans is making another boat.
I&#8217;m so sorry it isn&#8217;t done, Mrs. Dryer, as then we
should have room for you and the Doctor as
well. We think our boat is a great beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed she is,&#8221; added Effie. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a pleasant
day we can sail as well as row.&#8221;</p>

<p>To do Dr. Dryer justice, the thought of making
any objection never entered his head, though
that was what got him into trouble after Val
and Sibyl were gone.</p>

<p>As for Euphemia herself, that merry but unthoughtful
maiden saw so clearly the signs of a
coming storm in the now wintry smile of her
stepmother, that she actually put on her hat and
walked across the green with Sibyl Brayton and
Val.</p>

<p>The latter had done his part to admiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and was therefore content to delegate to George
Brayton the duty of seeing Effie safely home
again.</p>

<p>A long way home, considering the size of the
green. At least, that was what Mrs. Brayton
made up her mind to before she heard her son
close the door of his room on his return.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been Mrs. Brayton&#8217;s
thoughts, however, she wisely kept them to
herself.</p>

<p>So did Zebedee Fuller, although he remarked
aloud, as he returned to his father&#8217;s house that
evening:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I fully approve of that. Euphemia is a
fine young woman, and George is displaying
good sense. I wonder how it will strike old
Sol? I hope he won&#8217;t like it. I&#8217;ve seen Dorothy
Jane look sideways at George. There&#8217;s
every reason to hope she hates him. Wouldn&#8217;t
that be a pill, now? And they&#8217;d have to take it,
for the property&#8217;s all Euphemia&#8217;s, and she&#8217;ll be of
age in less&#8217;n two years. I could scarcely have
planned it better myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Zebedee chuckled an exceedingly great and
satisfied chuckle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>He had been over to see Bar Vernon about
having a grand good time on the lake, next day,
and had been sharply disappointed at the disturbance
of his plans. Bar had finally persuaded
him, however, that there was plenty of room on
the lake, and that he and the other fellows might
just as well get such boats as they could and have
their fishing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I suppose, Bar,&#8221; said Zebedee, &#8220;you and
Val and the rest will know enough not to interfere
with us. If there&#8217;s anything in the wide
world that unsettles my intellect, it&#8217;s a young
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t be afflicted,&#8221; laughed Bar. &#8220;You
may have the whole lake except the very patch
of water we are fishing in.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>A FEW SURPRISING DISCLOSURES</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Judge Danvers returned to the city he
at once set himself to the completion of his
plans for the liberation of Major Montague.</p>

<p>This was all the easier, because the very man
who had caused that gentleman&#8217;s arrest had done
so without any intention of actually bringing
him to any &#8220;trial and conviction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a net as they had cast around the Major
was readily untangled by the skilful fingers of
the great lawyer, even while he transferred the
whole of it to his own control.</p>

<p>As to the moderate sum of money it cost him,
he never once thought of that.</p>

<p>The immediate consequences were twofold.</p>

<p>The first, that Major Montague found himself
that Saturday morning, sitting in front of the
Judge&#8217;s table in the inner room of his <i>suite</i> of
&#8220;offices,&#8221; to all appearances, at least, a free man
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>The second, that the moment the doors of the
prison closed behind him and he found his movements
once more untrammeled, Major Montague
began to feel a strong return of his habitual
&#8220;bumptiousness,&#8221; not to say insolence, of disposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out now,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;and old
Danvers&#8217;ll never dream of sending me back
again. Besides, I don&#8217;t half believe he can.
Anyhow, I mean to make some kind of terms for
myself before I tell him all I know. It&#8217;s the
best card I&#8217;ve got and he must pay for it before
he plays it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another idea, and one against the evil of
which Judge Danvers ought to have carefully
guarded him, had been that he would go and
poison himself with &#8220;just about five fingers of
old rye,&#8221; before he went to the lawyer&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Not that such a man could find anything like
intoxication in a single drink of whiskey, however
liberal, but that it supplied him with the
very kind of wooden-headed obstinacy which he
thought he needed, and which fools of his kind&mdash;all
fools who drink whiskey&mdash;mistake for
courage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>&#8220;I can face him down now,&#8221; he muttered, as
he reached the door, &#8220;only I wish I&#8217;d put in just
one more real good snifter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another, most likely, would have been followed
by &#8220;just one more,&#8221; for his prison fare had
left him very &#8220;dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>There he was now, however, with the hard
penetrating eyes of Judge Danvers looking him
through and through as he asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see that black valise before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the one Jack Chills stole from me the
day he ran away,&#8221; said the Major, with a toss of
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No nonsense, please,&#8221; calmly responded the
lawyer. &#8220;Now, you&#8217;ve promised to tell me the
history of it and what is in it. Perhaps the
shortest way will be to open it at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my property, Judge,&#8221; said the Major,
in a voice which was getting louder and firmer.
&#8220;It&#8217;s mine, and I&#8217;ll open it when and where I
please. I&#8217;ll thank you to hand it right over to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand it over to you?&#8221; exclaimed the lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, or pay me my own price for it. I want
ten thousand down, and good security&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>&#8220;Pay you&mdash;you miserable jail-bird!&#8221; almost
fiercely interrupted the angry lawyer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Under other circumstances, the manifest indignation
of so dangerous a man as Judge Danvers
would probably have cowed the Major at
once, but the alcoholic poison he had absorbed
had done its usual work. He was&mdash;or seemed
to be&mdash;perfectly sober, but the idea uppermost in
his mind at the moment, was that he could assert
his ownership of that valise, and that he had the
physical strength to &#8220;clean out&#8221; not only the
lawyer, but his whole office full of clerks.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, therefore, and was
reaching out his long, powerful arm towards the
black leather prize, when the door of the office
swung open, just as Judge Danvers struck
sharply upon his sonorous little table-bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Norton!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge, whose
usually placid face was fairly purple with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Norton!&#8221; echoed Major Montague, as he
drew back his hand and turned to face the newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Davis!&#8221; shouted the Judge to the clerk who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
now put his head inside the door, &#8220;call an officer
and ask him to wait outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One here now, sir,&#8221; responded the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the Judge. &#8220;Sit down,
Montague. Mr. Norton, I am glad to see you,
but I&#8217;m very much occupied at this moment.
Please excuse me till I&#8217;m done with this person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! yes, of course; I beg your pardon,
really,&#8221; returned the Englishman. &#8220;But, Judge
Danvers, if you&#8217;ll allow me, I&#8217;d like to take a
look at your friend there. Did I hear you call
him Montague?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a strong expression of disgust on
the lawyer&#8217;s face when Norton began, but it was
now rapidly changing to one of intense curiosity
if not of expectation.</p>

<p>That of Major Montague, however, had undergone
an even more complete and rapid transformation.</p>

<p>He had even made a motion towards the door,
without so much as grasping for the valise, but
the assured presence of the &#8220;officer&#8221; in the outer
room came crushingly upon him, and he sank
back on his chair in a state of mind that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
plainly too much for even the strength of the
&#8220;old rye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbel Norton walked slowly and steadily
forward, looking straight in the face of the
Major, and it instantly occurred to Judge Danvers
that there was a decided resemblance to be
traced between them, although the Englishman
was somewhat the more slender and younger
looking of the two.</p>

<p>The only remark the Judge made was, however,
&#8220;Major Montague&mdash;Mr. Ashbel Norton,&#8221;
as if he were formally introducing two gentlemen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Montague!&#8221; again repeated the latter.
&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s very good indeed! Bob, you old
sinner, have I found you at last? What have
you done with Lydia&#8217;s child? Where are the
papers? Montague, indeed! Judge Danvers,
I&#8217;m more sorry and ashamed than I can tell
you; but I am compelled to make you acquainted
with my elder brother, Mr. Robert
Norton, formerly a gentleman and a Major in
the British army. What he is now you may
perhaps know as well as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The most cowardly of all wild beasts, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
wolf down to a rat, will show fight when he is
cornered, and the &#8220;Major&#8221; was, probably, never
a physical poltroon.</p>

<p>Well was it, therefore, that Ashbel Norton
had been an &#8220;Eton boy&#8221; and was a master of the
art of self-defence. Well too, probably, that his
graceless brother had no better weapon than his
huge fist at his command.</p>

<p>Ashbel warded off very skilfully the half-dozen
furious blows which were rained upon
him, but without once &#8220;striking back,&#8221; and by
that time there was a heavier hand than that of
Judge Danvers could have been, upon the shoulder
of the Major, and the &#8220;thud&#8221; of an officer&#8217;s
&#8220;locust&#8221; was beginning to sound on his head
and arms.</p>

<p>It was a hopeless sort of business, and the sudden
gust of uncontrollable rage died away into
a fit of utter dejection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Ash,&#8221; he exclaimed, as he was again
forced down upon a chair, &#8220;you&#8217;ve found me. I
should have made it all right myself, in a little
while. I was making arrangements for that
very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it right, Robert?&#8221; exclaimed Ashbel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Norton. &#8220;You make it right? I won&#8217;t speak
of the money you&#8217;ve wasted or the family you
have disgraced. I won&#8217;t say anything of the
way you ruined yourself and tried to ruin
others! Make it right? Can you make it
right with Lydia, for all she has suffered, or
with your own wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashbel,&#8221; huskily replied the now drooping
and trembling Major, &#8220;don&#8217;t speak of my wife.
I saw her death in the papers, years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she died of a broken heart,&#8221; interrupted
Ashbel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Lydia,&#8221; continued the Major, &#8220;I can
do something for her. I&#8217;ve kept every paper
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert,&#8221; exclaimed Ashbel, &#8220;Lydia, too, is
dead, and that, also, is on your own conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lydia dead? That, too, on me?&#8221; half
vacantly responded the Major. Whatever may
have been on his &#8220;conscience,&#8221; just then, if indeed
he still kept any such thing about him, his
mind was grasping at a very different idea, for
his next question was:</p>

<p>&#8220;And did she leave a will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed she did,&#8221; replied Ashbel, half angrily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ve no chance there. Judge Danvers has a
copy of it in his safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major stole a quick glance at the table
where the valise had been, but it had disappeared.
That too, was now &#8220;in the safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so Lydia&#8217;s dead,&#8221; slowly soliloquized
the Major, as he bent his eyes upon the floor.
&#8220;And she&#8217;s made a will. That was a turn of
things that never occurred to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing ever did seem to occur to you, except
your own brutal selfishness,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Ashbel Norton, but the Major turned now to
Judge Danvers, with:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to hear anything you&#8217;ve got to say
about that valise, Judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say?&#8221; exclaimed Ashbel Norton. &#8220;I&#8217;m the
only man who has anything to say about that,
Judge Danvers. You will understand that he
has nothing more to do with any of those
effects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are in my charge,&#8221; quietly remarked
the Judge, &#8220;not only as your own legal representative,
but also as counsel for the claimant
in the case, by whom they were deposited with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>&#8220;You have found him, then?&#8221; almost shouted
Mr. Ashbel Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied the Judge. &#8220;At all events
it will be necessary to protect ourselves against
any escape of Mr. Robert Norton. He must
be kept under lock and key till we need him
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge,&#8221; exclaimed the Major, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you
give me your promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And didn&#8217;t I keep it,&#8221; asked Judge Danvers.
&#8220;And didn&#8217;t you break your own, as soon as you
thought you had a chance? Take him in charge,
Mr. Officer. I&#8217;ll come right along and attend to
his commitment. Mr. Norton, I must really ask
you to excuse me until Monday at ten o&#8217;clock.
I have other persons to consult in this matter. I
hope you feel assured that your interests are
safe in my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Englishman seemed in a sort of brown
study for a moment, but then he held out his
hand, saying heartily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand it, indeed, but you
seem to have done wonders, already. The presence
here of my unfortunate brother, so completely
in your power, proves that. So does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
fact that you seem to have obtained possession
of the papers in so short a time. I&#8217;d no idea the
American detective police was up to that sort of
thing. Indeed, my dear sir, I trust the whole
matter entirely to your discretion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shall see you on Monday morning at
ten?&#8221; said the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without fail,&#8221; replied Norton, &#8220;only I can&#8217;t
see how I&#8217;ll take care of myself during the meantime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can manage that, I guess,&#8221; said the old
lawyer, as he grasped his hat and hurried
away.</p>

<p>His first care was to see that &#8220;Major Montague&#8221;
was properly secured where he could be
had when wanted, and he might well be pardoned
any lack of anxiety as to where and how Mr.
Ashbel Norton should worry away his time over
Sunday.</p>

<p>The Major&#8217;s affair was a very easy and simple
one, thanks to his hot temper and folly, but, as
soon as that was attended to, Judge Danvers had
an errand to the house of Dr. Manning.</p>

<p>His conference with the good physician was
by no means a brief one, and Val&#8217;s kind-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
mother was called in for her share of it, but
when it was concluded, Dr. Manning said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really very wonderful, all of it. I&#8217;m
very glad such an opportunity has come to me.
Of course, you can depend on me for any amount
of money it may cost to secure justice. How
much do you require now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge. &#8220;Not a
cent. Why, this is my affair. Do you take me
for a pauper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly that,&#8221; said the Doctor, with a
benevolent smile. &#8220;You are richer than I am,
for all I know, but I can&#8217;t consent to let you
work for nothing or pay my law bills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bills!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge. &#8220;Do
you think a man has no soul because he&#8217;s a
lawyer? I know that&#8217;s the prevailing impression,
but it&#8217;s wrong in my case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that fully,&#8221; replied Dr. Manning;
&#8220;but I want you to understand that I have at
least as deep an interest in this matter as you
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; replied the Judge, &#8220;if I lose
anything in it, I&#8217;ll call on you for your check for
half. Is that fair?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; said Dr. Manning. &#8220;When shall
you send for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First thing Monday,&#8221; said the Judge. &#8220;I
arranged that with him when I was there.
We&#8217;ll have this matter settled, or nearly so, before
we&#8217;re a week older.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all very well for them who seemed
to understand it, but what of the two impatient
boys up there in Ogleport?</p>

<p>What, too, of Mr. Ashbel Norton, fretting
and fuming at his hotel, or in aimless drives
around the city?</p>

<p>What, more than all, of Major Montague,
<i>alias</i> &#8220;Major Robert Norton, formerly of the
British army,&#8221; as he drooped and muttered behind
the bars of his solitary prison cell?</p>

<p>&#8220;I never dreamed of this,&#8221; he said, as if reproaching
somebody. &#8220;It came awfully near it
sometimes, that&#8217;s a fact; but I always thought I
could fend it off somehow. I always did, too,
till that young rascal caught me in a bad way,
and run off with that valise. And so poor
Lydia&#8217;s dead, and she&#8217;s left a will! Don&#8217;t I
wish I knew just what was in that will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Very likely he did, but, just as likely it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
not have done him any especial amount of good
if he had been familiar with every word of it.</p>

<p>He was only one of the vast crowd of human
beings who &#8220;make their own bed&#8221; and then have
to lie on it.</p>

<small>THE FISHING PARTY</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Saturday morning dawned fair enough
in Ogleport.</p>

<p>To be sure, there were a few clouds lurking
along the far away outlines of the hills, but they
did not seem to amount to anything in particular;
not even enough to justify Mrs. Dryer in bringing
such a very cloudy face to the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>She had said all she had to say, and that was
no very small thing, to the Doctor, before they
went to sleep the night before and as soon as
they waked up that morning, but she had somehow
failed in getting a fair chance at Euphemia.</p>

<p>In fact, for once in her life, to say the very
least, Effie Dryer&#8217;s face was not altogether sunny.
The usually smiling mouth had settled into lines
that betokened a mind made up and a temper not
to be trifled with.</p>

<p>It is barely possible that her father&#8217;s third wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
had sense enough to understand the meaning of
Effie&#8217;s face, and so, although there were clouds
enough at that end of the breakfast-table, they
followed the good example of those on the hills
and waited a better opportunity before breaking
into anything like a storm.</p>

<p>As for George Brayton, he had decided that
the trip to the lake should not be a &#8220;walk,&#8221; and
Runner&#8217;s best pair of horses, in front of what he
was pleased to call a &#8220;baroosh,&#8221; were on hand in
due time to transport the sailing-party, lunch
and all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wood had taken especial pains in the
preparation of the lunch, and even Zeb Fuller
would have been compelled to admit that there
was nothing &#8220;ghostly&#8221; about it.</p>

<p>There was a funny sort of smile on Mrs. Dryer&#8217;s
face when that span of horses was pulled up in
front of the Doctor&#8217;s residence, but she had no
other use for it than to keep it in its proper place,
above her teeth, till Effie had taken her seat beside
George Brayton and the &#8220;baroosh&#8221; disappeared
beyond the trees of the village green.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, her learned husband was glad
enough to plead several engagements with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Academy trustees and hurry away to keep
them.</p>

<p>Prompt as had been the departure of Bar and
Val and their friends, Zebedee Fuller and his
faithful cronies had the start of them and were
already tempting the perch and pickerel, when
the &#8220;baroosh&#8221; came to a standstill in front of
the somewhat heterogeneous home of Puff Evans.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Puff to Bar. &#8220;She&#8217;s
ready, name and all. There&#8217;s heaps of bait
under the seat and it&#8217;s a right down good day for
fishin&#8217;. Only there may be squalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Squalls?&#8221;</p>

<p>The word lingered in Bar Vernon&#8217;s ear for a
moment, but just then Effie Dryer exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is. The prettiest boat on all
Skanigo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, so she is,&#8221; replied Sibyl, &#8220;a very pretty
boat, indeed. What&#8217;s her name, Mr. Vernon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name?&#8221; repeated Bar, as the color began to
climb up across his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; exclaimed Effie, &#8220;painted on the
stern. Can&#8217;t you read? S-i-b-b-l-e, Sibble. Why,
what a queer name. Did Puff name her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say he had,&#8221; exclaimed George Brayton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
as he burst into a roar of laughter. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see, Sibyl? She&#8217;s named after you. Only a
few letters out of the way, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Bar!</p>

<p>Puff was attending to something else just then,
and Val Manning stood just where he could poke
his elbow into Bar&#8217;s ribs without being noticed.</p>

<p>As for Sibyl Brayton, she did not seem to see
where the fun came in, but stepped right forward
into the boat, like a brave and good girl as she
was. Even Effie Dryer followed her with a face
that was all one twinkle, but that did not let a
single laugh get loose.</p>

<p>There was need of at least one term at the
Academy for Puff Evans, that was clear, and Bar
was glad enough to busy himself with the fishing-tackle.</p>

<p>His intended compliment had become a thing
to be hidden from Zebedee Fuller, lest it should
be carved on half the loose boards of Ogleport.</p>

<p>There were only five of them, and the trim little
craft did not seem to care a fig for a lighter load,
as she danced away on the blue waves of Skanigo.</p>

<p>George Brayton himself was a very good hand
with a boat and he handled the graceful little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
<i>Sibyl</i> in a way that made her passengers forget
how very badly her name had been spelled for her.</p>

<p>Miles and miles away, up the lake, sped the
gay-hearted cruisers, right past the spot where
Zeb Fuller and his friends were steadily pulling
in their victims, until they reached a land-locked
sort of bay which Puff had indicated as a &#8220;sure
thing for good fishin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, indeed, the sail came down and the
anchor was thrown over, and Effie Dryer altogether
forgot her stepmother in the unwonted
excitement of watching for nibbles.</p>

<p>The nibbles came, too, plenty of them, and Val
Manning earned a new title to his chum&#8217;s devotion
by the forbearance with which he allowed
Bar not only to bait Sibyl Brayton&#8217;s hook, but to
take off and consign to the &#8220;fish-car&#8221; for her
every finny fellow who was reckless enough to
bite hard and stay on in spite of her unskilful
management of her line.</p>

<p>Effie Dryer had been on the lake many a time
before, and had a very good opinion of her own
skill, but she was somehow contented to allow
George Brayton to follow the example Bar
Vernon set him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>Fishing is sure to become tiresome in due time,
however, even if the biting is liberal, and before
noon all hands were ready to see the sail hoisted
again.</p>

<p>Then there was a &#8220;voyage of discovery&#8221; up
and down the rugged line of the lake shore, to
find a suitable place for their picnic.</p>

<p>Plenty of them there were, but it would not do
to throw away the fun of choosing, and at last
they pitched upon a spot, at the head of a deep
cove, shadowed by great rocks and tall overhanging
trees.</p>

<p>The <i>Sibyl</i> was hauled ashore; the girls were
helped out; a blazing fire was kindled; coffee was
made; the contents of Mrs. Wood&#8217;s ample basket
were brought to light; and then it was shortly
discovered that the best thing in the world to secure
a good appetite was to take a few hours of
sailing and fishing on Skanigo.</p>

<p>It was at the end of the lunch that Val Manning
once more covered his unselfish head with
glory, for he volunteered to look out for the boat
and the &#8220;things&#8221; while George Brayton and Bar
Vernon took the young ladies for a stroll among
the rocks and trees, and up and down the shore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>Splendid fun that was, but Bar Vernon was
yet a good deal of a &#8220;boy,&#8221; for one of the first
things he said to his companion was:</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t think I didn&#8217;t know how to
spell your name. That was all Puff Evans&#8217;s
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you really did name your boat after
me?&#8221; asked Sibyl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I did,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;You are the
only Sibyl I ever knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very kind of you,&#8221; she answered,
gently; &#8220;and I think she is a beautiful little
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was not a prouder fellow on or about
Skanigo Lake at that moment, than Mr. Barnaby
Vernon.</p>

<p>That sort of thing could not last forever, though
it might be ever so pleasant, and Val Manning&#8217;s
self-imposed watch at the shore was shortly
terminated.</p>

<p>It was not quite so warm or sunny just now,
and if Puff Evans had been within speaking distance,
it is very likely he would have spoken a
word of warning, but the party in the boat had
not the least idea in the world that any danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
to them could be lurking among the clouds and
hills.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was not, indeed, for their only
real danger was in their own ignorance and
sense of security.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; Zeb Fuller had remarked a few minutes
before, &#8220;there&#8217;s a squall coming. We&#8217;d
better pull up the lake. City folks are all fools,
you know, and there&#8217;s no telling what may
happen to &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Good for Zeb, only he came very near being
too late, in spite of his wise forethought.</p>

<p>The <i>Sibyl</i>, with her precious freight, had
danced away lively enough from the launching-place,
but had scarcely made a mile before the
wind seemed almost to die out, so Val Manning
suggested to Bar that they had better take a turn
at the oars.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Bar, &#8220;there&#8217;s more a-coming.
Don&#8217;t you see that dark-looking ripple out
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Effie Dryer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Bar, pointing with his finger,
&#8220;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it comes!&#8221; exclaimed Brayton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>Come it did, indeed!</p>

<p>There was no time to bring the boat around
to it&mdash;no time for the slightest precaution&mdash;no
time for anything but a wild cry of fear from
the two girls&mdash;and then all five of them were
floundering in the mocking waters of Skanigo,
while their beauty of a boat lay capsized and useless
beside them.</p>

<p>Half a mile from shore, and no life-preservers!</p>

<p>It was a good thing that the male members of
that party could all swim well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for Miss Dryer,&#8221; shouted Bar to
George Brayton; &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep Sibyl up. Val, try
to right the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Brayton had felt a great pain at his
heart the moment before, but Bar&#8217;s words
seemed to take it right away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you keep her up?&#8221; he anxiously inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, George,&#8221; said Sibyl herself, &#8220;and he&#8217;s
brought me an oar. You take care of Effie.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was quite enough for one man to do,
though Effie met the emergency very courageously;
but she could not swim a stroke, and
the water was becoming a trifle rough.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>Val Manning had, at first, come very near
being entangled with the boat, and even now he
could hardly understand how it was that his
friends had come to the surface and &#8220;paired off&#8221;
so very nicely.</p>

<p>It may be because they had been sitting together
and so have gone overboard in company.</p>

<p>At all events, he saw that the most important
duty of all had fallen on his own shoulders, and
he set about it like a hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the halyards,&#8221; shouted Bar, &#8220;and let the
sail come down. You&#8217;ll never right her without
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val obeyed, for the heavy, water-soaked sail
had toppled clean over upon him the first time
he tipped up the boat, knocking him under the
water.</p>

<p>Relieved of this impediment, it was not so
very difficult to get the boat once more on an
&#8220;even keel,&#8221; or to swim around and pick up the
floating oars, but whatever of her cargo which
could not float or swim was already at the
bottom of the Skanigo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her gunwale is only an inch or so above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
surface,&#8221; exclaimed Val. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how we
are ever to bail her.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a terrible whiteness on George
Brayton&#8217;s face just then, and Effie Dryer must
have seen it, for she said to him in a low voice,
&#8220;I understand. You must leave me and swim
ashore. You must save yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; he hoarsely replied, but it was a
dark moment in the life of George Brayton.</p>

<p>Just then, however, Bar Vernon caught hold
of a piece of wood that floated past him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the rudder, Sibyl,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Now put that and the oar under your chin.
Are you brave enough to float on that? It&#8217;ll
keep your head above water while I go and help
Val.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
afraid about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A rare girl was Sibyl Brayton, and in a moment
more Bar came swimming to the side of
George Brayton with another oar and one of the
movable boat-seats.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;ll help you keep her
up. Val and I will bail out the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing but their hats, indeed, to start with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
though the water was not so rough now. Still
the waves would splash over in, and their work
seemed almost hopeless. One inch. Then another!</p>

<p>If their strength and that of George Brayton
and the girls would only hold out!</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar,&#8221; exclaimed Val, &#8220;try and get over the
stern without upsetting her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try it,&#8221; said Bar; &#8220;you&#8217;re lighter than
I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a perilous experiment, for it endangered
all they had thus far gained, but in a minute or
so more Val Manning was in the boat and bailing
for dear life.</p>

<p>Bar turned, every now and then, for a look at
his other friends.</p>

<p>Sibyl&#8217;s face was pale, but she was steadily
obeying his injunction &#8220;not to try to keep too
much of her above water.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Brayton was doing all a man could do,
but it was evident that he was fast becoming
fatigued, while Effie Dryer seemed almost afraid
to look at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can only get in and help Val,&#8221; groaned
Bar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>But just then, sweeter than the sweetest music
Bar had ever heard in his life, a chorus of wild
yells from boyish throats came to his ears across
the water, and around the nearest point of land
he saw the great, clumsy, scow-built punt which
Zeb Fuller and his friends had borrowed for
their day&#8217;s fishing coming on at as great a
resemblance to speed as her crew of excited boys
could give her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Overboard, all of them!&#8221; had been Zeb&#8217;s exclamation,
as the scene of the disaster opened
upon him. &#8220;Pull, boys, pull! No time now
for remarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pull they did like good fellows, only it seemed
to them very much as if the heavy old scow
were anchored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage!&#8221; shouted Bar to Sibyl; &#8220;there&#8217;s
help coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage, Effie,&#8221; murmured George Brayton.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, too,&#8221; she said, in reply. &#8220;Oh,
you must keep up! For my sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For yours? Then, indeed, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>They needed whatever encouragement and
strength they could get all around before the
punt arrived, but then Zeb Fuller and Hy Allen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
seemed to make nothing at all of pulling in the
girls, one after the other. In fact, Brayton was
compelled to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gently, now, boys,&#8221; more than once, by way
of moderating their somewhat headlong strength
and eagerness.</p>

<p>Bar had been on hand to help, but now he
swam back to the <i>Sibyl</i> and clambered in.</p>

<p>That unlucky craft was beginning to be a little
less water-logged, and Zeb Fuller tossed over a
big, rusty tin basin, with the aid of which the
work went on tenfold more rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saved, thank God!&#8221; exclaimed George Brayton,
as he sank, dripping and exhausted, on a
seat of the punt, opposite to Effie and his sister.</p>

<p>Neither of them said a word aloud, but there
was no doubt they were saying the same thing
in their hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those two brave boys, too,&#8221; said Effie, a moment
later. &#8220;I scarcely know how we are to
thank them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Zeb and his friends,&#8221; began George
Brayton, but that young worthy interrupted him
with:</p>

<p>&#8220;No thanks, please, Mr. Brayton. It&#8217;s an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
every-day matter with us. We get our pocket
money by it. If the man&#8217;s drowned we charge
only a dime, but if we get him ashore alive,
it&#8217;s twenty-five cents. We&#8217;ve done lots of harm
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harm?&#8221; exclaimed Sibyl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Zeb, gravely, &#8220;but then
it&#8217;s so hard to decide, on the spur of the moment,
whether we ought to let a man drown or
not. I fear we are influenced too much by the
odd fifteen cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worn out as he was by his long struggle in
the water, Brayton was forced to laugh at Zeb&#8217;s
way of avoiding unwelcome gratitude, and Effie
Dryer&#8217;s face half lost the expression of deep,
sweet thoughtfulness it had worn ever since she
came out of the water. As for Sibyl, she was
intently watching Bar and Val at their work,
which was now nearly completed.</p>

<p>In a few moments the <i>Sibyl</i> was once more in
sailing trim and the picnic party could abandon
the slow safety of the punt and start for home.</p>

<small>TWO IMPORTANT TELEGRAMS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> results of that boating excursion were
nothing short of &#8220;nuts and honey&#8221; to Mrs. Dr.
Dryer. Never in all her life had she been
blessed with so magnificent an opportunity to
say: &#8220;I told you so!&#8221;</p>

<p>She said it, too, very abundantly, and what
puzzled her, as well as took away half the sweetness
of her triumph, was the fact that her unsubmissive
stepdaughter did not seem to be in the
slightest degree cast down about it.</p>

<p>In fact, no sooner had Effie put on dry clothing
than she seemed to look back upon her day
of danger and disaster as one whose happiness
had been absolutely without a cloud.</p>

<p>She praised the drive, the sail, the lunch, the
boys; she even expressed a decided liking for a
compulsory bath in Skanigo. And then she put
on an obstinate fit of silence and refused to say
another word about it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>The rest of the population of Ogleport required
further time and more accurate information.</p>

<p>Their first vague impressions had been to the
effect that Zebedee Fuller had swum, five separate
times, half the width of Skanigo, each time
bringing back with him a half-drowned man or
woman, and that then he had gone again and
towed home the boat.</p>

<p>There were manifest flaws in that narrative,
however, and little by little the truth was presented
and accepted; but even then Zeb remained
a hero, as usual.</p>

<p>Somewhat different was the state of Mrs.
Brayton&#8217;s mind after hearing Sibyl&#8217;s account of
her adventure, and who shall blame her if, right
at the supper-table and before they had a chance
to sit down, the good motherly, excited lady
half-weeping gave to Bar Vernon and Val Manning
a dozen grateful kisses?</p>

<p>Hysterical?</p>

<p>Say it for yourself, then!</p>

<p>The boys hardly thought they had deserved so
much, but when a mother has come so very near
losing her only daughter, she has a right to express
her feelings in any way she chooses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>Perhaps, if Sibyl had been consulted, she
might have remarked that Val came in for an
even share with Bar, when the latter was clearly
entitled to a majority.</p>

<p>The thought of rectifying the matter did not
enter her head, doubtless, but she felt all the
more kindly disposed towards her handsome and
somewhat mysterious young preserver.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and the only telegraph
office of Ogleport was not open, except
for an hour or so in the morning, like the post-office.</p>

<p>The churches were, however, and they were
all full, especially the one in which Mrs. Wood
had her pew, and many were the curious glances
directed at her array of remarkable &#8220;boarders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the members of the Dorcas Society were
compelled to admit that Mrs. Brayton and her
daughter were &#8220;nice,&#8221; while it was well for her
son and his two young pupils that their vanity
was spared the golden opinions heaped upon their
manly heads.</p>

<p>Very early on Monday, however, there were
two telegrams brought by the &#8220;messenger&#8221; to
the house of Mrs. Wood. One was for George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Brayton. He, however, had no knowledge of the
other.</p>

<p>It found him very busy over a letter that he
had taken from that morning&#8217;s mail, and which
was signed &#8220;Ashbel Norton.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter and the telegram were both read to
his mother and sister, and the former said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, George, this is as good a place as any.
We will wait here till you return.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was likely Mrs. Dryer would have another
opportunity to say: &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first thing that George Brayton had to
say to the principal, when he met him in the
Academy chapel, was to announce that he had
been summoned out of town and might be gone
for several days.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see how I shall be able to spare you
at present,&#8221; remarked the Doctor, coldly, and Zeb
Fuller would have noted the disuse of long
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is imperative,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;I cannot
help myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will the trustees say to such a
dereliction?&#8221; asked the Doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I care much,&#8221; was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
somewhat nettled reply; &#8220;but as they are fair
and right-minded men, they will doubtless approve
my going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was something for Mrs. Dryer; but the
Doctor was not the man to face so decided an
answer, and he turned the subject with:</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is your young friend, Mr. Vernon?
Manning is over yonder, in his proper
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vernon?&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he here?
That&#8217;s strange. Well, he&#8217;ll turn up. I&#8217;m exceedingly
sorry, Dr. Dryer, but this is a matter
which may involve a large sum of money. I
must take the next stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was really no help for it, but it might
have interested George Brayton if he had
known that Bar, with a &#8220;traveling bag,&#8221; which
he had ready packed for days, had waited, his
telegram in his pocket, just below Runner&#8217;s tavern
that morning, and had taken the early stage
from the North without losing time in making
arrangements with Dr. Dryer.</p>

<p>The driver of the coach had no unnecessary
scruples. To him it was only one more passenger,
whether he picked him up at the proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
place or not, and Bar was miles away from Ogleport
by the time his absence was known to any
one but the faithful Val.</p>

<p>The latter, indeed, was in every bit as excited
a state of mind as when he was bailing out the
boat the previous Saturday, and he kept as cool
and steady an exterior now as then, like the
&#8220;trump&#8221; that he was.</p>

<p>Now it happened that when George Brayton
walked away from the Academy, he caught sight
of a female form some distance ahead of him,
walking steadily away down the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;Mrs. Dryer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Precisely. No other.</p>

<p>And yet the young man made no manner of
effort to overtake her, but turned his footsteps,
instead, directly across the green, towards the
home she had left behind her.</p>

<p>It was a safe sort of calculation to make, for
Euphemia was there&mdash;and no one else besides.</p>

<p>Considering how nearly they had come to being
drowned together on Saturday, it was in every
way natural and polite that George Brayton
should wish to make her a farewell call before
hurrying away out of town on Monday.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>Still, it is likely the doctor&#8217;s wife would have
given something to have been present at that
interview.</p>

<p>It might have been interesting even to good
Mrs. Brayton herself.</p>

<p>It certainly was to George and Effie, and the
former went on to Mrs. Wood&#8217;s afterwards, with
a stronger feeling than ever that he cared very
little indeed whether school kept or not. Alas,
for Effie Dryer&#8217;s peace!</p>

<p>No human eyes had noticed George Brayton&#8217;s
entry of her father&#8217;s front door, but a very human
pair had seen him go away. After that,
it only needed that the cup should be filled with
the news the Doctor himself brought home at the
noon &#8220;recess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Euphemia!&#8221; almost frantically exclaimed
Mrs. Dryer, &#8220;he is going. Do you mean to say
that you are going with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; calmly responded Effie, but with
an extra flush on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now? What do you mean? Why not
now?&#8221; demanded her stepmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he forgot to ask me,&#8221; said Effie, demurely.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_356.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Because He Forgot to Ask Me</span>&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>&#8220;Do you mean you would if he did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he ever does, I shall tell him, but I&#8217;ve no
intention of telling you, now or then,&#8221; said Effie,
firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane,&#8221; said the Doctor, with a narrow
escape from being very sensible, for once,
&#8220;it occurs to me that Euphemia only displays a
suitable degree of feminine reserve and delicacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feminine fiddlesticks,&#8221; replied his third.
&#8220;This is what comes of chemical apparatuses,
and buggy-riding, and walks, and talks, and upsets
in the lake. I hope he&#8217;ll never come back, I
do. Are his mother and sister going with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe not,&#8221; said Effie. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
stage, now; you can look out of the window
and see for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dryer acted instantly on Effie&#8217;s suggestion,
but the latter stepped as quickly to the
front door, and it was not in defiance of &#8220;Dorothy
Jane&#8221; that the white signal waved so gay a
farewell from the window of the departing
stage-coach. And Dr. Dryer went back to his
duties that afternoon, with a dim idea that the
schoolroom was a sort of refuge, after all, in
spite of Zebedee Fuller.</p>

<small>THE BLACK VALISE IS OPENED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. Ashbel Norton called on Judge
Danvers, according to appointment, that Monday
morning, he found the old lawyer alone in
his private office, with a small, black leather
valise lying on the table before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Norton,&#8221; he said to his
visitor. &#8220;Do you recognize this at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly well,&#8221; replied Norton. &#8220;I have
seen it a hundred times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When and where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the hands of my brother-in-law, at his
house, years ago. I could scarcely say how
often. He kept many of his papers in it, often
matters of value. It was a handy thing to carry
to and from his banking-house, or to put away
and lock up anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is part of the property, then, of which you
came in search?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly. I should certainly claim it if it
were not already in your own custody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>&#8220;I shall then proceed to take the responsibility
of opening it,&#8221; said the Judge, as he touched his
little bell; &#8220;but I must have witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment more, two law-clerks were called
in as &#8220;lookers-on,&#8221; while another sat at a desk
and wrote out an inventory of the various papers
and matters in the valise, as the Judge called
them off.</p>

<p>&#8220;No money,&#8221; he said, at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; replied Mr. Norton; &#8220;we
could trust Robert for that. Nor anything he
could handily turn into money. That is the
will, beyond doubt, and it has evidently been
opened and read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm for us to read it over again, then,&#8221;
said the Judge. &#8220;I&#8217;ll excuse you now, gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment they were alone, the Judge proceeded
with a perusal of the ancient-looking
document, while Ashbel Norton listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is marvelous!&#8221; exclaimed the latter, at
the close, &#8220;how nearly my poor sister seems to
have recalled every word of it. It was made
originally with her sanction and approval, and
she has obeyed it as far as was possible, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
the circumstances. It will now greatly aid us in
carrying into effect the terms of her own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The property seems to have been large,&#8221;
remarked the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said Norton, &#8220;and almost all of it
in available shape&mdash;stocks, bonds and the like.
Very little real estate. My sister had been well
provided for, so that she was never cramped, you
know, or anything of that sort. Still, the whole
thing was a dreadful blow to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it would have been,&#8221; remarked
the Judge. &#8220;But did you never, until now, have
any idea in what direction your brother had
gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure we did,&#8221; replied Norton, &#8220;and
that was the worst of it. We heard from him,
or thought we did, on the Continent, in the
Colonies, in India, everywhere. We spent a
mint of money in searches. This last hint, you
know, came from himself. He thought, perhaps,
he might get something out of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now what shall we do with him?&#8221; asked
the Judge.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing that puzzles me!&#8221; exclaimed
Norton. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be nobody to dispute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
will, now it&#8217;s found. Indeed there could hardly
be any dispute about it. But we don&#8217;t want any
row made or public notoriety. We&#8217;ve suffered
enough. All I want of him is to tell us when
my nephew died, if he&#8217;s dead, or where he is if
he&#8217;s alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will easily make him do that,&#8221; replied
the Judge, &#8220;and then he&#8217;s done enough in this
country to have him put out of the way for
years, if we wanted to, but I&#8217;ve no malice against
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I, indeed,&#8221; said Norton. &#8220;Even my
poor sister forgave him, and she&#8217;d suffered more
than any one else, unless it may be his own wife,
poor thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Things looked pretty black for Major Montague,
or Major Robert Norton, it must be confessed,
for the longer the lawyer talked with his
English client the clearer it became that there
remained little enough of power, either for good
or evil, in the wretched man who had done so
much of the latter.</p>

<p>There he sat in his cell that day, nevertheless,
scheming and calculating and plotting for all the
world as if he really had what he called &#8220;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
hold&#8221; upon old Judge Danvers. If he expected
to be sent for at once, however, he was very
much mistaken.</p>

<p>Indeed, just as the Judge was about to start
for home that night, a sharp, alert, wiry-looking
little gentleman stepped into his office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, Mr. District Attorney,&#8221; said
the lawyer. &#8220;What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you have put that fellow Montague in
quod again. Want him for anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Witness, perhaps, for a few days. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s all right. I won&#8217;t interfere till
you&#8217;re through with him. Want him myself
after that. Been looking for him this long time,
only I didn&#8217;t know he was the man till to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather, I should say. Forgery, swindling,
pocket-picking, all sorts. I hardly know what&#8217;s
on the list. Pretty much everything. Spoil him
for a witness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on a bit, then,&#8221; said the Judge; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
turn him right over to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the District Attorney.
&#8220;I&#8217;m always glad to oblige a man like you. He&#8217;s
a bad one. Good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Ashbel Norton need have no fears about
his family name,&#8221; muttered the Judge; &#8220;but
how about all the Montagues? Their name&#8217;s
going to the penitentiary by a large majority.&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed no help for it, and it was not
any fault of Judge Danvers, either.</p>

<p>That evening he had another long talk with
Dr. Manning, which was ended with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, he&#8217;ll come right here. Send him
down to my office with as little delay as possible.
I must have a talk with him before anybody else
knows that I&#8217;ve found him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, there was small need of so
many precautions, but the old lawyer could
hardly have done his work in any other way if
he had tried.</p>

<p>As for Bar Vernon, it had seemed to him that
morning as if there never could have been so
slow a stage-coach anywhere else in all the world,
and he caught himself glancing enviously at the
telegraph wires. He had secured a perch beside
the driver on the box, and at last he asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your horses to-day?
They seem to go like snails.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snails, is it?&#8221; angrily exclaimed the driver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
&#8220;S&#8217;pose you ask &#8217;em? I reckon I know how fast
hosses ort to be druv.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, you off nag,&#8221; suddenly inquired Bar,
as the driver had suggested, &#8220;is that the best
you can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Best I can do,&#8221; returned the off horse, with
a toss of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly!&#8221; exclaimed the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; again demanded Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Low feed,&#8221; replied the animal, or at least so
it seemed to the driver, and again he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly!&#8221; and added a long whistle of utter
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they give you?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shingle nails and lager beer,&#8221; dolefully returned
the now clearly harassed animal. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
bother me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of it!&#8221; exclaimed Bar. &#8220;No wonder
he can&#8217;t travel fast on such feed as that. I can
see &#8217;em sticking through him, now. Poor fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow, yourself,&#8221; stammered the driver.
&#8220;Look a-here, young man, who be you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I?&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m half
horse, myself, on my aunt&#8217;s side, and her right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
hand side at that. You don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d tell
me any lies, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did, though,&#8221; replied the driver, who
had edged away as far as the seat would let him.</p>

<p>Men of his class are not likely to be lacking
in &#8220;cuteness,&#8221; however, and it was not long before
the truth began to dawn on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold,&#8221; he said, musingly. &#8220;Jeff Rogers sold
by a runaway schoolboy. Sold on hoss talk, too.
Who&#8217;d ha&#8217; thought of sech a thing? But then,
how well he does it! Beats the perfessionals all
holler.&#8221;</p>

<p>At all events, it helped a good deal to while
away the time till Bar was able to exchange the
slow-moving coach for the swiftness and comfort
of the railway express train which was to carry
him on towards the city.</p>

<p>Little did Bar imagine what was or might be
waiting for him on his arrival, although he
&#8220;imagined&#8221; at the liveliest kind of rate.</p>

<p>Trust a boy for that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Even the lightning express train, at last, began
to seem as if it must have been kept for awhile
on some kind of &#8220;low feed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing short of a trip by telegraph would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
have really answered the requirements of Bar&#8217;s
very natural impatience.</p>

<p>Small blame to him, therefore, if he mystified
a whole car-load of passengers by the questions
he asked and the answers he obtained from poor
fellows who were stealing rides under the floor
and out upon the roof of the car.</p>

<p>He couldn&#8217;t help it, you know.</p>

<small>THE ACADEMY &#8220;GHOST&#8221; DISCOVERED</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Bar himself had passed that day in a state
of ill-suppressed excitement, he had left a very
volcanic state of things behind him.</p>

<p>Before matters at the Academy had a fair
chance to settle into their customary routine, the
news had passed swiftly from desk to desk and
bench to bench, whispered, penciled, chalked,
everything but telegraphed or shouted, that &#8220;Bar
Vernon&#8217;s run away,&#8221; and this was speedily followed
by, &#8220;Mr. Brayton&#8217;s gone after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time the scholars were let out for the
noon &#8220;recess,&#8221; the same messages, in various
shapes and forms, had made the swift circle of
Ogleport, and more than one boy found himself
confronted, at corners of the green, by a more or
less matronly inquisitor, anxious to &#8220;know about
it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was surprising, too, very much so, what
clear and circumstantial statements of the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
those boys were prepared to give, but if any one
among them faltered in his tale, that one was
not named Zebedee Fuller.</p>

<p>The amount of &#8220;faith&#8221; afloat in Ogleport was
quite likely to be all called for whenever the
different inquirers at Zeb&#8217;s mouth should come
to compare notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Val,&#8221; he dolefully exclaimed, as he encountered
that young gentleman, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to help
me out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of what?&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bar hasn&#8217;t run away and George isn&#8217;t
after him, but what am I to say about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it up,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep what up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bar is off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar off? You don&#8217;t mean to say he&#8217;s cut it
for good?&#8221; was Zebedee&#8217;s almost breathless
response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say about that,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;All I
know is that he went away this morning, and
may be gone some days, if not longer. There&#8217;s
a secret in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there?&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;That&#8217;s a great comfort.
You won&#8217;t tell old Sol, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>&#8220;Tell him what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know it myself, and I ain&#8217;t half
sure that Bar does. He&#8217;s gone after it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And George, too, he must have a secret,&#8221;
groaned Zeb. &#8220;I think I must tell Dorothy
Jane to keep a sharp eye on Euphemia. Val
Manning, it&#8217;ll be a bad thing for Ogleport to lose
Bar Vernon just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang Ogleport!&#8221; exclaimed Val. &#8220;Think
of me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Zeb, with a look of deep sympathy
out of his left eye, &#8220;your case is a hard
one. Val, don&#8217;t you think the wind is rising a
little?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems so,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a bit westerly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More and more west.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Val, the Academy ought to have a chance to
express its grief over the loss of Bar Vernon.
You and I had better go and carry the sad news
to the old bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Val felt as if that sort of thing would give
his mind just the relief he needed, and by the
time the bell had finished its midday work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
recalling the boys to their studies, its last duty
for the day, the &#8220;van&#8221; in the western gap of the
steeple had been securely hitched to the tolling
gear, and two agile forms were creeping down-stairs
as lightly and silently as cats.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind will be higher towards night,&#8221;
said Zeb to his friend, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no telling
when the bell may begin to express his feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they both returned to their desks
and duties with a truly wonderful degree of
firmness, sticking bravely to their books in spite
of more than one ominous wave of grating sound
which came creeping down upon them from the
bell-tower.</p>

<p>There was that upon Dr. Dryer&#8217;s mind that
day, which so absorbed it that no ordinary interruption
would have sufficed to secure his attention.</p>

<p>Indeed, never in all their experience of him
had his pupils been so puzzled to get at the
meaning of his &#8220;explanations,&#8221; while he once so
far wandered from an exact use of terms as to
address Hy Allen as &#8220;Euphemia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hiram was afterwards compelled to thrash half
a dozen small boys and one large one before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
could deliver himself from the consequences of
that slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>Hiram would rather have died than have submitted
to being called Euphemia Allen, or even
&#8220;Effie,&#8221; much as he doubtless admired the Doctor&#8217;s
pretty daughter.</p>

<p>School was out at last, however, and Zebedee
Fuller led the way to the mill-dam for the accustomed
swim.</p>

<p>He found Gershom Todderley and Patrick
Murphy strolling about outside the mill, in a
way which plainly indicated their readiness to
listen to any kind of news from &#8220;up-town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor were they by any means disappointed
either as to quantity or quality, for Zeb relieved
Val Manning of all necessity for answering questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; suddenly exclaimed Pat. &#8220;Hear
that, now! Begorra, that&#8217;s the bill bruk loose
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, the bell!&#8221; sighed Zeb. &#8220;Somebody
has told the old fellow about George Brayton
and Bar Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s towled for?&#8221; asked
Pat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Patrick,&#8221; said Zeb. &#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose it
told itself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s doin&#8217; the noo,&#8221; exclaimed
Pat. &#8220;It&#8217;s ownly a praste can do anythin&#8217; right
for that same bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my opinion,&#8221; said Zeb, solemnly.
&#8220;Those ghosts from Mrs. Wood&#8217;s are at it in
broad daylight. What are we coming to?&#8221;</p>

<p>If the wind had been a steady one there is
really no telling what the result might have
been, but the lulls were so frequent and so prolonged
that the intervals of silence became more
difficult to comprehend than even the sudden
outbreaks of half-tipsy tolling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Val,&#8221; said Zeb, as he and the boys
cut short their watery fun and began to dress
themselves. &#8220;It&#8217;s time we were on hand at the
Academy. They&#8217;re pretty sure to get at it this
time, and I&#8217;m almost sorry we set it a-going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stronger and stronger blew the western blast,
as the boys marched up the street and across
the green, and wilder and more protracted were
the bell&#8217;s expressions of its sorrow for the loss of
Bar Vernon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a crowd of mourners, I declare,&#8221; remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
Zeb, as he pointed to the assemblage on
the Academy steps and scattered over the green
before it. &#8220;The bell has done well.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, however, there was indeed
a commotion.</p>

<p>There were more than a few of the female
population of Ogleport whose curiosity had
brought them out upon the green, just when
they should have been at home getting supper
ready; but now, out from the Academy
door, followed in dubious silence by her husband,
strode the triumphant spouse of Dr.
Dryer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she exclaimed, as she pitched Bar
Vernon&#8217;s invention down upon the grass, &#8220;it
was that thing did it. All it needed was a
woman to find it out. That&#8217;s your ghost. Now,
Dr. Dryer, I&#8217;d like you to find out who put it up
there. Zebedee Fuller, come here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeb promptly responded, with Val at his side,
and there were auditors in almost uncomfortable
abundance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, sir,&#8221; demanded Mrs. Dryer, pointing
to the wreck of the van, &#8220;did you ever see that
before?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>&#8220;That?&#8221; responded Zeb. &#8220;Everybody knows
what that is, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, then?&#8221; exclaimed the Doctor, incautiously,
and Zeb&#8217;s face was all aghast with
amazement at such a display of ignorance in such
a man, as he respectfully replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;That, Dr. Dryer, is a philosophical apparatus
for measuring the strength of the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zebedee!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Dryer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strength of the wind?&#8221; said her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Doctor,&#8221; continued Zeb; &#8220;the harder
the wind should blow the louder the bell would
toll. I have no doubt of it. Still, I should prefer
to have Mr. Brayton explain it to you, as my
own information is limited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brayton?&#8221; cried the triumphant lady. &#8220;I
told you so. Don&#8217;t you remember? He was up
there every time. Of course it was Brayton.
He and that Vernon boy knew all about it. No
wonder they ran away together. I told you so!
Come, Dr. Dryer, we had better go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot water for George when he gets back,
I&#8217;m afraid, if not for Barnaby,&#8221; muttered Zeb;
&#8220;but the bell don&#8217;t seem to feel as bad as it
did. Come on, Val.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>The two were walking rapidly away
across the green when they were again
halted by a softer voice than that of Mrs.
Dryer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zeb Fuller, what did you mean by laying
that to Mr. Brayton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do anything of the kind,&#8221; replied
Zeb; &#8220;it was Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you let her think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;I never touched her.
Euphemia, George is as innocent of that bell
business as you or I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Effie burst out into a merry peal of laughter
over Zeb&#8217;s response and the manner of it, but
there were other curious questioners drawing
near, and she hurried away.</p>

<p>Away from that spot, indeed, but her father&#8217;s
house did not come to Effie&#8217;s mind just then, as
the pleasantest place of refuge in the world, and,
instead of seeking that shelter, she turned her
footsteps towards Mrs. Wood&#8217;s for a bit of a
chat with Sibyl.</p>

<p>A very excellent choice, but why should Effie
Dryer have blushed so deeply, when Sibyl&#8217;s
mother met her in the hall and put her soft arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
around her and gave her such a sweet and motherly
kiss?</p>

<p>So very different was that kiss from any that
Effie had received from her father&#8217;s third wife.</p>

<small>GOOD NEWS FOR BAR</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> George Brayton arrived in the great city
that Tuesday morning, he went directly to the
hotel designated by Ashbel Norton&#8217;s telegram,
and neither one of them had the slightest suspicion
that an earlier train had brought a more important
passenger.</p>

<p>The Englishman had a good deal to tell Brayton,
of course, but it was nothing compared to
Dr. Manning&#8217;s talk with Bar Vernon, at an earlier
hour, before he sent him down to the office of
Judge Danvers.</p>

<p>Poor Bar!</p>

<p>If his brain had been busy during his journey,
it was all in a whirl now, and the only real help
he got was when good, sweet-faced Mrs. Manning
put her arm around him and said, as if she could
not help it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if they had but found you before your
mother died!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>That was just what Bar needed, for it brought
the tears to his eyes, and there is nothing else in
all the world so good as a few tears at the right
time and place.</p>

<p>By the time Bar reached the law-office, therefore,
he was as clear-headed and ready-witted as
the Judge himself could have asked for, and the
latter confessed his surprise at the way his young
friend comprehended every point of the story,
and at the really important things he was
able to bring to light from his &#8220;old time&#8221;
memory.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no difficulty whatever,&#8221; exclaimed
the Judge. &#8220;Indeed, I do not imagine
Mr. Norton, or those he represents, will attempt
to make any. I never saw a case more entirely
clear of doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all like a dream,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but I suppose
it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough,&#8221; said the Judge. &#8220;Now go and
get a lunch, for you must be tired enough, with
all these papers. By the time you get back, I
think, the rest will be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby was glad enough to get a bit of sunlight
and a breath of fresh air, not to speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
coffee and oysters, although the latter were by no
means unwelcome.</p>

<p>When he returned to the law-office, however,
he passed through the outer rooms, to Judge
Danvers&#8217;s own private door, with a heart which
beat more and more briskly at every step.</p>

<p>He put his hand upon the latch, but the door
seemed almost to swing open of itself, and then, as
he entered, a tall figure sprang from an opposite
chair and a well-known voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bar Vernon! You here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brayton? You?&#8221; returned the no less
astonished Barnaby; but still another gentleman
was on his feet, and the voice of Judge Danvers
broke in with:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ashbel Norton, let me make you acquainted
with your nephew, Barnaby Vernon;
Bar, my boy, this is your uncle, your mother&#8217;s
brother, of whom I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barnaby and Mr. Norton were now standing,
their hands tightly grasped, gazing in each
other&#8217;s faces, and the latter said, in a steady, deliberate
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge Danvers, there isn&#8217;t the shadow of a
doubt. He&#8217;s the very image of his father. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
member of the Norton family will swear to him
on sight. He hardly needs the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has them!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge.
&#8220;It was from his own hands that I received them,
when he engaged me as his counsel. Your brother
Robert has also repeatedly acknowledged him as
his nephew, Barnaby Vernon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t speak of him again, Judge,&#8221; said
Mr. Norton, sadly. &#8220;We shall not trouble him
for his declaration in this matter. You are my
nephew&#8217;s counsel. May I ask who has acted as
his guardian?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Randall Manning, one of our most distinguished
and wealthy physicians. He sent him
to an academy at Ogleport, in this State, and
Barnaby came from there this morning by telegraph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had,&#8221; remarked Bar, &#8220;instead of by
that slow old stage-coach and that railway
train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fact!&#8221; exclaimed the Judge. &#8220;I believe I&#8217;m
getting excited. Anyhow, Mr. Norton, your
nephew is in excellent hands, and I may say we
are all deeply interested in his fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please include me in that list,&#8221; interposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
George Brayton. &#8220;I owe Bar about as much as
one man can owe another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; asked Norton.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; said George. &#8220;Why, he saved my
sister&#8217;s life last Saturday, and, I think likely, all
the rest of our party, by his coolness and courage
and good conduct. I&#8217;ll tell you all about it some
day. All I want to say now, Mr. Norton, is that
not only you find your nephew in good company,
but he&#8217;s a relative any man may be proud to
find.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever of pecuniary loss or disappointment
Bar Vernon&#8217;s &#8220;discovery&#8221; was likely to bring to
either of those two men, they seemed to be
equally glad to find him, only Mr. Norton exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Lydia! If she could only have lived
till now!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Judge, I really don&#8217;t care to see Robert
again, and yet I can&#8217;t bear to do anything against
him. He is my brother, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make yourself easy on that score,&#8221; said the
Judge. &#8220;The District Attorney called upon me
last night, with reference to a man named Montague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
and I think we need say no more on that
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; remarked Brayton, &#8220;it was somehow
on his account that my own family are
brought into this arrangement of the Vernon
property, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only as a sort of reparation,&#8221; returned Norton.
&#8220;Robert&#8217;s wife, whose life he destroyed by
his wickedness, was your mother&#8217;s sister, and
Barnaby&#8217;s mother, my sister Lydia, was tenderly
attached to her. The legacy you have in her
will was her own to give, and was to have been
doubled if this will of Bar&#8217;s father came to light,
so that property could be reached. My own
legacy is in the same shape. If, however, we had
found the Vernon will, and Barnaby had died before
his mother, all the property would have been
hers, and your share and mine would have been
vastly increased. I&#8217;m glad enough, however, that
he is alive to claim it, for I have abundance already,
and enough of the Vernon estate comes to
me by my sister&#8217;s will as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to me and mine, too, I should say,&#8221; exclaimed
Brayton. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t a ray of legal
claim to it, otherwise than by will.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>&#8220;Then it seems,&#8221; suddenly remarked Bar, &#8220;that
I am an Englishman, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely that,&#8221; said Mr. Norton, with a smile.
&#8220;Your mother was an Englishwoman, but your
father was a New Yorker, and you were born
within three miles of where you are now sitting.
You have to come over and pay your English relatives
a visit, however, as well as to take possession
of your property.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That can be done for him,&#8221; said Judge Danvers.
&#8220;For my own part, I should strongly oppose
removing him from school at present. I
wish, Mr. Norton, you&#8217;d have a talk with Dr.
Manning about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both he and yourself have a perfect right to
be consulted,&#8221; said the Englishman, heartily.
&#8220;We owe you a great deal of consideration in
this matter; Mr. Brayton, do I understand that
young Vernon is actually under your care at
Ogleport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said George, &#8220;and boarding in the
same house. He has Dr. Manning&#8217;s own son for
a room-mate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Manning&#8217;s own son!&#8221; exclaimed Norton.
&#8220;Well, Judge Danvers, do you know, this is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
very remarkable? very gratifying? Considering
the habits and character of my poor brother,
you know we were almost afraid to find my
nephew. Expected, of course, he&#8217;d be unfit for
civilized society, and all that sort of thing. It&#8217;s
a very happy disappointment, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it would be,&#8221; said the Judge,
with enthusiasm, &#8220;and it&#8217;ll get better and better,
the more you know him. Why, sir, I meant to
make a lawyer of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll have a chance, yet,&#8221; replied
Norton; &#8220;but he may prefer something else when
he grows up and has seen a little of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world, indeed!&#8221; remarked Judge Danvers.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not half sure but he&#8217;s seen as much
of the world as an average Englishman already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the important question of Bar
Vernon&#8217;s recognition by his relatives could now
be safely regarded as settled, and his personal
presence was hardly required for the transaction
of mere &#8220;law business&#8221; between Judge Danvers
and &#8220;the representative of the Vernon estate,&#8221;
Bar and George Brayton shortly left the
lawyer&#8217;s office for a walk and talk on their
own account.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said Brayton, &#8220;you and I are not
even cousins, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer kind of cousins,&#8221; said Bar, with a
laugh, &#8220;but I am half sorry for it. I wish I
could call your mother my aunt, you see. I
wonder if I&#8217;ve any aunts over in England? I
must ask Norton about that. How do you like
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;But do you
mean to go to England with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by a good deal!&#8221; exclaimed Bar Vernon,
with great energy. &#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d
go over there, as ignorant as I now am, and let
them all find it out? No, sir! I&#8217;ll study ten
times harder than ever, till I feel I&#8217;ve nothing to
be ashamed of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Brayton. &#8220;So you&#8217;d
better go back to Ogleport with me and I&#8217;ll look
out for your improvement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But will you go on teaching school, now
you&#8217;re so rich?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be so very rich,&#8221; said Brayton, &#8220;and
it&#8217;ll be months before I get hold of any of it.
Besides, I&#8217;m under contract at the Academy,
unless they let me off. By the way, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
get back, I want you to keep this whole matter
a profound secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will indeed,&#8221; replied Bar.</p>

<small>HOME AGAIN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ashbel Norton</span> and Mr. George Brayton
spent the evening of that day at Dr. Manning&#8217;s,
and the former had an excellent opportunity
for getting better acquainted with
his new-found nephew and the friends he had
made.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all may be summed up, however,
in the words of Judge Danvers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Brayton,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since you
also are disposed to put your affairs in my hands,
there is nothing for it but for me to prepare to
go to England with Mr. Norton, on his return.
Meantime, you had better take Barnaby back to
his Greek and Latin and mathematics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been discussing that very thing,&#8221; said
Brayton, &#8220;and that is about our conclusion.
For my own part, I do not feel justified in remaining
away from my duties an hour longer
than is necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>&#8220;I put the various law papers required in
course of preparation, to-day,&#8221; said the Judge,
&#8220;and they will be ready for you to sign, so that
you can leave the city to-morrow night. As for
Bar, he is a minor yet, and all his business can
be taken care of for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will answer for his family in England,&#8221; remarked
Ashbel Norton. &#8220;We are all entirely
satisfied that things should take the shape you
indicate. Only there is no need of haste, for,
now I am over here, I&#8217;d like amazingly to see
more of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve all our splendid autumn weather
before you for that,&#8221; replied Dr. Manning.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no better time in all the year. I only
wish I could leave my practice and go with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was arranged, but Bar Vernon took
the Judge aside before the evening was over, and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Judge Danvers, how about Major
Montague in all this? I&#8217;ve no malice against
him, in spite of all he has done. He seemed always
to have a sort of liking for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or for the money he meant to make out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
you, some day,&#8221; replied the Judge. &#8220;When
he stole you away, he thought he would be sure
of a reward for sending you back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he, then?&#8221; asked Bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so far as I can understand it,&#8221; said the
Judge, &#8220;too many of his own misdeeds were
coming to light about that time, and he was
compelled to remain in hiding till things had
blown over a little. Of course he kept you with
him and took some kind of care of you. It was
all pure selfishness. He seems to be a very bad
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But ought I not to see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, I think. There is no danger but
that we shall be able to find him any time we
wish to. We will talk about it one of these
days. All I want you to do now is to make a
man of yourself as fast as you can. You&#8217;ve
begun well, from all I can hear. Keep it
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve seen what
some things lead to clearly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say you had,&#8221; was the lawyer&#8217;s very
emphatic rejoinder.</p>

<p>But, while matters were going ahead so very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
swimmingly in the great city, there were almost
equally busy times in Ogleport.</p>

<p>Val Manning found himself invited, that day,
to a private conference with Dr. Dryer. Not
for any misdeeds of his own, as he was very
carefully assured, but to ascertain what he might
know as to the sudden disappearance of his
room-mate.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not tell me a word,&#8221; said Val, &#8220;except
that a telegram from his counsel called him
back to the city. He could not say when he
would return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His counsel? He&#8217;s very young to have
counsel. Do you mean Judge Danvers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Val.</p>

<p>Bar Vernon was growing rapidly to the stature
of a very large boy, in the mind of the
Academy principal, but he had unwisely, though,
perhaps, necessarily, admitted his ruling half
to that conference, and Mrs. Dryer broke in
with:</p>

<p>&#8220;All an excuse, Dr. Dryer. I&#8217;m astonished
that you allow yourself to be hoodwinked in that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to me!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Who
was it found out all about the bell business?
It&#8217;s your duty to write at once to Dr. Manning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Val, quietly. &#8220;I should be glad
to have you do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Dryer had a good deal more to say,
and she said it without missing a word, in spite
of the Doctor&#8217;s frequent attempts to interject
ideas of his own.</p>

<p>At last, however, Val was released, to find
Zebedee Fuller waiting for him at the gate,
while Dr. Dryer was retained a close prisoner in
his study until he had actually written that
letter to Bar Vernon&#8217;s &#8220;Guardian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what more we can do about it,&#8221;
said Zeb, as he and Val walked off towards the
Academy, for it was at the noon recess. &#8220;The
bell business has gone all to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m half sorry for that,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;It looks
as if it would all have to come out one of these
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly will,&#8221; replied Zeb, &#8220;unless we
can set the Ogleport people to thinking about
something else. Even then it&#8217;ll be hard to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Dorothy let up on George. At all events, we
mustn&#8217;t allow him to suffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Val. &#8220;She can&#8217;t do him a
bit of hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Zeb, &#8220;I do wish we had Bar Vernon
with us. The man that invented that bell
business must be up to other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed he is,&#8221; said Val; &#8220;but don&#8217;t you be
afraid. He&#8217;ll turn up here again some fine
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure of that?&#8221; exclaimed Zeb. &#8220;Then
there&#8217;s hope for the future of Ogleport yet.
There comes old Sol.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was a dismal day for the principal, however,
and his several male and female subordinates
had the &#8220;teaching&#8221; pretty much in their
own hands, such as they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Effie,&#8221; said Sibyl Brayton to her friend, as
they met on the green, a little before the close
of school, &#8220;can you keep a secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; said Effie. &#8220;Is it anything
comical?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t comical at all,&#8221; said Sibyl. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
just had a telegram from my brother George.
He and Bar Vernon will be here to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s caught him?&#8221; said Effie, hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Effie!&#8221; exclaimed Sibyl, &#8220;Bar didn&#8217;t
go after George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t George&mdash;I mean Mr. Brayton,&#8221;
said the blushing Effie, &#8220;go after Bar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Sibyl, &#8220;and it&#8217;s all a puzzle to me.
I don&#8217;t understand a bit of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>No more did Euphemia, but there were sharp
eyes prepared to watch for the early stage from
the South next day. They were duly rewarded,
too, and George Brayton had plenty of time to
tell his mother and sister the news, so that the
latter could carry it over to Dr. Dryer&#8217;s for
Effie&#8217;s benefit as soon as she had a good chance
that afternoon.</p>

<p>As for George Brayton and Bar, they at once
got rid of the dust of travel, and scarcely were
the several rooms of the Academy filled, after
the noon recess, before Val Manning&#8217;s &#8220;chum&#8221;
dropped quietly down into his accustomed seat
beside him, while, at the same moment, the assistant-principal
resumed the discharge of his own
duties, for all the world as if he had not been
gone ten minutes.</p>

<p>Dr. Dryer was in another room at the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
and when he returned he started as if he
had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brayton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Doctor. Back again, safe and
sound, you see. Hope my absence has not occasioned
any inconvenience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The departure of even subordinate members
of the faculty of this institution,&#8221; solemnly responded
the principal, &#8220;can hardly fail to occasion
approximate disturbances of its organization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; muttered Zeb Fuller to himself,
in his corner; &#8220;only he&#8217;ll choke himself
with a big word yet, and then what&#8217;ll become of
Dorothy?&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Brayton, he simply said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for that, of course, but it couldn&#8217;t
be helped. Mr. Vernon returned with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, with me. Had a very pleasant journey
together. I met him in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brayton, may I see you after school?
This matter seems to need looking into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said George, as he prepared to go
on with his classes, but Zebedee&#8217;s face fell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>&#8220;Short words, all of &#8217;em,&#8221; he soliloquized.
&#8220;Must have learned them of Dorothy.&#8221;</p>

<p>At another time George Brayton might have
showed signs of rebellion, but he saw nothing
very dreadful in the idea of going over to Dr.
Dryer&#8217;s house after school. It may, indeed,
have been the very thing he would have asked
for.</p>

<p>Bar Vernon attended rigidly to his duties that
afternoon, but there was nothing to prevent him
from using slate and pencil, and, before school
was out, Val Manning had a very fair outline of
all Bar had to tell him.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, the latter suddenly discovered
what a lion he had become.</p>

<p>As Zeb announced to &#8220;the boys,&#8221; not only
had Bar returned safe and well, but &#8220;he
has also distinguished himself by bringing back
Mr. George Brayton with him. I could have
done but little more myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that very moment, however, the proposed
&#8220;looking into&#8221; George Brayton&#8217;s absence was
beginning at the house of Dr. Dryer, and never
before had the principal tried to look so large, or
felt so really insecure about his actual size.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Brayton,&#8221; he began, &#8220;may I ask where
your journey conveyed you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;City and back,&#8221; said George, curtly. &#8220;Business
errand, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I also venture to inquire as to the object
of your journey?&#8221; asked the principal, with
increasing dignity, while his wife smiled upon
him her completest approbation, and Effie&#8217;s blue
eyes expanded with surprise and indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; quietly responded Brayton,
without the quiver of a nerve.</p>

<p>&#8220;You refuse a satisfactory response to my interrogation?&#8221;
exclaimed the Doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said George, &#8220;if it isn&#8217;t satisfactory
it ought to be. The business I went on was my
own, not yours. I don&#8217;t see why you should
take any special interest in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of his business?&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Dryer, aghast. &#8220;Is that the way you understand
your duty to your superior? Perhaps you
will say that this, too, is none of his business?&#8221;</p>

<p>With that the angry lady plucked from behind
the sheltering folds of her dress the remains of
Bar Vernon&#8217;s tolling machine, and cast it widespread
upon the carpet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Brayton, with a mild
look of curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, sir,&#8221; said the Doctor, severely, &#8220;is the
part of our philosophical apparatus which you
have basely deflected from its proper uses for the
alarm and disturbance of this peaceful community.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Dryer,&#8221; said Brayton, as he struggled to
suppress a laugh, &#8220;has Ogleport gone crazy since
last Monday morning, or are you the only sufferer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell me, Doctor, where did you find
that thing, and what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Find it?&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Dryer. &#8220;I found
it myself up in the steeple, where it was tolling
the bell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tolling the bell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, that and the wind, just as you meant
it should. Do you suppose the Ogleport Academy
supplies philosophical apparatus for tolling
bells with?&#8221;</p>

<p>George Brayton&#8217;s face had been getting redder
and redder, and Euphemia&#8217;s handkerchief was
not at her eyes, by any means, but he managed
to stammer out:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>&#8220;Have you asked Zeb Fuller about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sort of magic in the mention of
that name, at least, to anybody in Ogleport, and
it suddenly occurred to Mrs. Dryer that it was,
indeed, from Zeb that her suspicions&mdash;information
she had deemed it&mdash;had been derived, and
at the same moment the Doctor himself began
to wrestle with a new idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy Jane,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I begin to
fear that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Effie had restrained her mirth as long as
was in any way possible, and George Brayton
permitted himself to catch the infection of it
very freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Dryer,&#8221; he said, as soon as he could speak
plainly again, &#8220;this must, indeed, be looked into;
but we had better take our time at it. Other
hands than Zeb&#8217;s have been at work on that
affair. Mrs. Dryer deserves great credit for detecting
it. I will come over again after tea, and
she must tell me all about it. Just now I can&#8217;t
stay any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Doctor and his wife sat and looked each
other in the face in mute astonishment as the
young man rose and walked to the parlor-door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>They did not even breathe a word to Effie as
she merrily followed him, and so they did not
hear a syllable of what passed between those
two in the outer hallway.</p>

<p>Nobody else did, but it seemed to interest
them very much.</p>

<p>Indeed, as Brayton was compelled to whisper
a part of it, he was also forced to lean his face
very close to Euphemia&#8217;s in a way which would
surely have caused Zebedee Fuller to say, had he
been at hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dorothy would hardly approve of that, but
I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alas, for Dorothy Jane!</p>

<p>For once in their wedded life the Doctor himself
was now able to turn upon her with:</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you so. Now, if he lets it out we shall
have all Ogleport laughing at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that was just what Mrs. Dryer dreaded of
all things in the world, for the Dorcas Society
was to meet at her house the very next day.</p>

<p>One consequence, however, was that when
George Brayton &#8220;came over after tea,&#8221; he found
that an important errand had called away his
venerable superior, and that Mrs. Dryer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
confined to her own room by a headache or
something, leaving poor Euphemia to do the
honors of the house all alone.</p>

<p>So she did them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnaby,&#8221; said Mrs. Brayton to our hero,
that evening, &#8220;George tells me you agree with
him that the less we say about this English matter
the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the present, yes,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;but such
things always leak out after a while. I&#8217;d rather
keep quiet as long as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you not a sort of a cousin of ours
now?&#8221; asked Sibyl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d let it be so,&#8221; said Bar, &#8220;for I
have no American cousins, that I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they may turn up one of these
days,&#8221; said Mrs. Brayton. &#8220;Anyhow, the Vernon
estate, your father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s, has done
enough for us, and I&#8217;ll be glad enough to play
aunt for you. Indeed, I&#8217;ll be as much of a
mother to you as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cousins are better than sisters,&#8221; said Sibyl.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so, Bar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; replied Bar. &#8220;I never had either,
and so I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>&#8220;You shall call me either one then, just as you
please,&#8221; exclaimed Sibyl; &#8220;but I can&#8217;t give you
my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is to be my aunt, then!&#8221; said Bar.
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;ll do splendidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Bar and Val reached their room at last
that night, there was nothing for it but to go
over the whole ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s grand,&#8221; was Val&#8217;s enthusiastic commentary.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a regular hero of romance. But
I&#8217;m ever so glad you&#8217;re not to leave Ogleport this
year. Won&#8217;t we have good times! You&#8217;ll have
loads of pocket-money, of course, and I always
get plenty. Oh, won&#8217;t we have fun, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>

<p>There did indeed seem to be a very fair prospect
of it, and Bar Vernon&#8217;s &#8220;old time&#8221; seemed
to be drifting further and further away from
him, while the present and the future, the &#8220;new
time&#8221; concerning which he had hoped so much,
and for which he had struck out so boldly, grew
brighter and more real to him every hour.</p>

<p>George Brayton must have required a good
deal of advice that evening, but his mother reproved
him very gently indeed for his prolonged
call at the Doctor&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>It may, or may not be, that George deemed it
his duty to report as to the absence of the Doctor
and his wife, but it&#8217;s just as likely he did not.</p>

<p>Zebedee Fuller and his dog Bob were out by
the side of the little river that night, for another
raid on the eels; but, although their usual good
fortune attended them, the brow of the young
village-leader was clouded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s back again, Bob,&#8221; remarked Zebedee, as
a larger eel than common tangled himself up
with the line on the grass. &#8220;That young man I
told you of is back again, and he&#8217;s brought back
George with him. Now, George&#8217;ll have enough
to do looking out for Dorothy while he courts
Euphemia, but what are Gershom Todderley and
you and I to do with Bar Vernon? We can&#8217;t
afford to let him be idle. No, Bob, he must improve
his time. Oh! how I wish Dorothy Jane
had all those eels in her lap, or, say, in her
pocket, and was reaching down for her spectacles
just now. There are many comforts we can&#8217;t
have in this world, Bob, and that&#8217;s one of &#8217;em.
But between me and you and old Sol, we&#8217;ll find
work for Barnaby Vernon this term, sure!&#8221;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
